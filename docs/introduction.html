          <h2>Quote by Viktor E. Frankl</h2>
        </header>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Don&#39;t aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more
            you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued;
            it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one&#39;s
            personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of
            one&#39;s surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and
            the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about
            it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go
            on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see
            that in the long-run - in the long-run, I say! - success will follow you
            precisely because you had forgotten to think about it.</p>

          <h2>Choose Life</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Warrior is the oldest name for it. Since our days in Africa we have
          progressed forward and the word has evolved many times.</p>
        <p>At each stage there are strong lessons to be learned, directly, or
          indirectly.</p>
        <p>Whatever your calling, wherever you break away to make your stand, even if
          you fail to reach the top of your mountain, know that you will surely reach
          the rays of the sun, know that you will become part of the Great Family of
          Heroes, know that countless many will follow, and that your footsteps will
          become a well worn path, in time.</p>
        <p>The lessons come from Philosophers, Scientists, Thinkers, Soldiers,
          Presidents, Athletes, Mercenaries, Murphy’s Law, Mighty Little Girls &amp;
          Young Ladies, Mothers, Sisters, Brothers, and Fathers. From empathy and
          compassion, joy and tragedy, triumph and disaster, and great challenges
          like learning to live and grieve at the same time, or standing with the
          demonized, disposable, or voiceless.</p>
        <p>The lessons come from, Choosing Life.</p>
        <p>To progress forward, we must be ready to learn to understand by subtle
          analogy from all other theories. Theories of survival, of living above the
          common levels of life, of choosing heroism, choosing greatness. Striving to
          thrive, rising to impossible challenges, learning to overcome pain and
          suffering, and standing upon the shoulders of giants to lead the way for
          others to follow.</p>

        <p>Who includes diversity and is Nature,</p>
        <p>Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of
          the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,</p>
        <p>Who has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose
          brain held audience with messengers for nothing,</p>
        <p>Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,</p>
        <p>Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and
          of the æsthetic or intellectual,</p>
        <p>Who having consider’d the body finds all its organs and parts good,</p>
        <p>Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by
          subtle analogies all other theories,</p>
        <p>The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;</p>
        <p>Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other
          globes with their suns and moons,</p>
        <p>Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for
          all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,</p>
        <p>The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.</p>
