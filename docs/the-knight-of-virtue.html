        <h2>Sir Galahad</h2>
        <p>As we grew so did our grasp on the Human Condition, from bloody and warring
          clans of duty and loyalty a new kind of class emerged.</p>
        <p>The Knight of Virtue.</p>
        <p>Internal influences are as just as powerful at changing a human, as the
          external ones. To internalize Knightly Virtues, to live by them, to triumph
          by them, became a sure way to become a hero.</p>
        <p><strong>Forbearance, Hardihood, Largesse, Benevolence, and Honour.</strong></p>

        <h2>Sir Galahad</h2>
        <h3>Alfred Lord Tennyson</h3>
        <br>
        <p>My good blade carves the casques of men,</p>
        <p>My tough lance thrusteth sure,</p>
        <p>My strength is as the strength of ten,</p>
        <p>Because my heart is pure.</p>

        <h2>Men of Pure Heart</h2>
        <p>Superheroes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galahad">Galahad</a> carried a message that put servitude second.
          For one cannot uphold the Knightly Virtues whilst blindly following orders
          issued by someone who does not strive to uphold them.</p>

        <h2>Knight&#x27;s Oath</h2>
        <h3></h3>
        <br>
        <p>The right can never die, If one man still recalls, The words are not
          forgot, If one voice speaks them clear, The code forever shines, If one
          heart holds it bright.</p>
        <p>The knight is sworn to valor, His heart knows only virtue, His blade
          defends the helpless, His might upholds the weak, His words speak only
          truth, His wrath undoes the wicked.</p>

        <p>A code of conduct that aimed to revolve around Authenticity, was born.</p>

          <p>Chivalry! - why, maiden, she is the nurse of pure and high affection, - the
            stay of the oppressed, the redresser of grievances, the curb of the power
            of the tyrant - Nobility were but an empty name without her, and liberty
            finds the best protection in her lance and her sword.</p>

        <p>What we know of the superheroes of middle ages comes from poems and
          recreations of the lost arts.</p>

        <h2>Above the Common Levels</h2>
        <p>By subtle analogy to high pursuits in modern era, we can estimate that to
          aim for greatness, to climb the highest of mountains built Hardihood,
          enabled Largesse, taught Benevolence, and helped with Honour.</p>
        <p>The stories of Virtuous Knights are journeys of pursuit of knowledge, and
          self discovery, of trials and tribulations, of overcoming and rising, of
          triumph and disaster.</p>
        <p>To search for the Grail, or Arthur, Percival, or Galahad, and the others;
          was to find the Knightly Virtues and Wisdom set to timeless songs and poems.</p>
