        <h2>The road between the past and the future is long, but it continues unbroken.</h2>
        <p>Relative to their beginnings, many will find just enough comfort and stop,
          and often block traffic.</p>
        <p>If you rise in class. Your teachers will fight you, because they just want
          to do their job, go home, and get paid.</p>
        <p>If you rise in class. They will say you are disrupting the class and throw
          you out, because they just want you to shut up so they can finish their job
          and go watch some TV.</p>
        <p>You can talk to the Principal or Dean, but they&#39;ll just tag you as &quot;Gifted&quot;
          and you&#39;ll graduate from Adult Ed so fast you&#39;ll struggle to remember where
          it all started and what the battle was for.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Because The Battle Is Not For You</h2>
        <p>The battle is for those that come; after you.</p>
        <p>In short term, you get a sweet sliver of solace as you learn that in the
          end all your troubles ended up counting towards protecting others from the
          same.</p>
        <p>In long term, you help the world grow, it won&#39;t be your world, it will be
          the world of the future.</p>
        <p>The battle for real education, and enjoying the fruits of real education
          are two separate things.</p>
        <p>It will make you tired.</p>

        <h2>Bad News</h2>
        <p>There are very few Alternate Education resources, and as you rise you
          realize that the Start-up Accelerator rates are extremely low, almost too
          low.</p>
        <p>Nothing, nothing is as sweet and easy as putting up with broken education,
          the broken rules, the status quo, staying in school, getting some &quot;good&quot;
          grades, making your parents happy.</p>
        <p>Nothing is as easy as forgetting all of that ever happened, and make up
          excuses after excuses, forgetting everyone and everything, and never
          looking back.</p>
        <p>Alas, Dear Henry comes to our rescue.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only
            the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to
            teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.</p>
          <p>I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish
            to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary.</p>
          <p>I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so
            sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a
            broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to
            its lowest terms...</p>

        <h2>The Good News</h2>
        <p>Real Education, is not about getting really educated.</p>
        <p>It is about Your Life, Dignity, Authenticity, Health.</p>
        <p>Life that revolves around sweet and easy and making everyone else happy is
          not a healthy life.</p>
