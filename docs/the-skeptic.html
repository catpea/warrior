        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>The widespread urban legend that one swallows a high number of spiders
          during sleep in one&#39;s life has no basis in reality. A sleeping person
          causes all kinds of noise and vibrations by breathing, the beating heart,
          snoring etc. all of which warn spiders of danger.</p>

        <h2>Cognitive Biases</h2>
        <p>Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or
          rationality in judgment, and are often studied in psychology and behavioral
          economics.</p>

        <h2>False Memory</h2>
        <p>Article adjustment on eyewitness report. Loftus&#39; meta-analysis on language
          manipulation studies suggested the phenomenon effects taking hold on the
          recall process and products of the human memory. Even the smallest
          adjustment in a question, such as the article preceding the supposed
          memory, could alter the responses. For example, having asked someone if
          they&#39;d seen &quot;the&quot; stop sign, rather than &quot;a&quot; stop sign, provided the
          respondent with a presupposition that there was a stop sign in the scene.
          This presupposition increased the number of people responding that they had
          indeed seen the stop sign.</p>

        <h2>False Etymologies of English Words</h2>
        <p>The actual origin of the phrase &quot;the whole nine yards&quot; is a mystery, and
          nearly all claimed explanations are easily proven false. Incorrect
          explanations include the length of machine gun belts, the capacity of
          concrete mixers (in cubic yards), various types of fabric, and many other
          explanations. All are probably false, since most rely on nine yards when
          evidence suggests that the phrase began as &quot;the whole six yards&quot;. In
          addition, the phrase has appeared in print as early as 1907, while many
          explanations require a much later origin date.</p>

        <h2>English Usage Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>Misconception: The words &quot;and&quot; and &quot;but&quot; must not begin a sentence. Those
          who impose this rule on themselves are following a modern English &quot;rule&quot;
          that was not used historically. Jeremy Butterfield described this perceived
          prohibition as one of &quot;the folk commandments of English usage&quot;. The Chicago
          Manual of Style says: There is a widespread belief—one with no historical
          or grammatical foundation—that it is an error to begin a sentence with a
          conjunction such as &#39;and&#39;, &#39;but&#39;, or &#39;so&#39;. In fact, a substantial
          percentage (often as many as 10 percent) of the sentences in first-rate
          writing begin with conjunctions. It has been so for centuries, and even the
          most conservative grammarians have followed this practice.</p>
