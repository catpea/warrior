        <h2>Raspberry Pi</h2>
        <p>The $35 <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> is the most handsome in a class of computers
          called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer">Single-board computers</a>. They just released version 4, <strong>so make
sure you get that one</strong>; and don’t forget a monitor. BestBuy does sell the
          PI, packaged in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rcNjgVgc-I">Raspberry Pi 4 Cana Kit</a>. Personally, I think
          getting the original keyboard and mouse is really cool, I am not a fan of
          the plastic case and would go for a cool looking <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VD568FB/ref=twister_B07VD58LGV?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Heat Sink “Case”</a> -
          and then probably short something out. Good news is that ashens has a two
          part review of all the popular cases here you go: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpTlB6oju5w">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYb2IEsfhnE">Part
            2</a>. Heads up, ashens is an odd British man that utters odd British
          phrases.</p>

        <h2>Heist</h2>
        <p>She likley stole her daddy’s dad’s password by using her older brother’s
          <a href="https://www.amazon.com/keylogger/s?k=keylogger">key logger</a>. To log into her dad’s computer she uses the ssh command.
          ssh is just a program that establishes a secure (encrypted) connection
          between two computers. She executes ssh <a href="mailto:&#x61;&#108;&#101;&#x78;&#64;&#x31;&#57;&#x32;&#x2e;&#49;&#54;&#56;&#x2e;&#x31;&#46;&#x32;&#x37;">&#x61;&#108;&#101;&#x78;&#64;&#x31;&#57;&#x32;&#x2e;&#49;&#54;&#56;&#x2e;&#x31;&#46;&#x32;&#x37;</a> at <a href="https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=87">1:27</a>. And
          begins using the ssh program.</p>
        <p>The remote shell, for convenience sake, looks almost the same as her own
          local shell. Even though very little changes on her screen she is in a
          full-screen program now, and once she is authenticated her shell prompt
          changes to that of the remote system. It goes from pi@calebpi ~ $ to
          []~$[].</p>
        <p>A shell prompt is the thing that indicates that you are free to type
          commands. Her dad’s shell prompt is broken, he messed up with whatever was
          supposed to go in between those square brackets, it maybe that he is using
          fonts that the Raspberry PI does not have, or some mess like that. My
          prompt as I write this is [user@computer warrior]$ that means username is
          user, my computer’s network name is computer, and the directory I am in is
          warrior.</p>
        <p>The dollar sign $ indicates that I, alex, and pi are normal users. You can
          escalate your system privileges to become a system administrator where you
          can read or delete other user’s files. On most systems the dollar sign
          would then change to the pound sign # to indicate that care must be taken
          as you are in special privileges mode, often called <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/R/root.html">root</a>.</p>

        <h2>Warning</h2>
        <p>Now, when the Little Hacker Lady, logs into her dad’s computer she makes it
          talk using the <strong>say</strong> command.</p>
        <p>A command is a feature of the Operating System, using commands is a
          management or administrative task, it is not really true programming, but
          it is OK to call it that.</p>
        <p>The say command uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis">speech synthesis</a> to convert text to speech. The
          say command resides on her dad’s computer, and thus uses her dad’s speaker.
          She executes the command at <a href="https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=310">5:10</a></p>
        <p>The command she executes is wonderfully illustrative:</p>
        <p><strong>say -v serena dad watch out</strong></p>
        <p>You see that -v that’s a special directive that states when executing the
          say command use the voice of serena, serena is a cute name for a library of
          sounds, the say command supports multiple voices, serena is one of them.</p>
        <p>How do people know that -v means voice, and how do they know that serena
          is one of the voices? <strong>Nobody knows this at first</strong>, before a person
          executes a command they read about it in a manual. The manual command is
          called man and people usually type man followed by the command-name that
          they want to learn about. In this case: man say (meaning bring up the
          manual page for the say command). The man page will tell you how you can
          list all the available voices too (say -v=?), a command like say can do
          multiple things based on what you are trying to do. Here is the internet
          version of a man page for say: <a href="https://ss64.com/osx/say.html">https://ss64.com/osx/say.html</a></p>
        <p>People are not happy with this. Many try to create simplified man pages,
          here is one example <a href="https://tldr.sh/">https://tldr.sh/</a> but it is always best to go to
          the source, and just get used to the man command.</p>
        <p>She didn’t need to use the serena voice library, she could have just
          executed:</p>
        <p><strong>say dad watch out</strong></p>
        <p>And the say command would use the default voice. The say command is mostly
          available on Macs, Raspberry Pi will likely use the espeak command.</p>
        <p><strong>espeak &quot;dad watch out&quot;</strong></p>
        <p>Espeak command is slightly different, for it gets confused by multiple
          words, you have to join them together by wrapping them in quotes. A
          programmer should demand that his program code has good hygiene. eSpeak
          simply said “I am not just going to read everything that you type at me”
          whereas the programmer that made the say command said “Let’s just assume
          that whatever they throw at us needs to be converted to speech unless
          something starts with a hyphen”. The say command makes assumptions, whereas
          espeak is very strict about input.</p>

        <h2>The Kill -9</h2>
        <p>At <a href="https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=229">3:49</a> the Little Lady Hacker explains that she will be shutting down
          her dad’s code editor, and writes down the Process ID number 95251. Mac
          users frequently use <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> code editor. She issues the kill
          command with the -9 switch, this is a terrible idea, as it basically
          crashes her dad’s code editor and the -9 ensures there is no way to save
          data. Here is the man page for the kill command
          <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill">https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill</a>. Unix programs that are actively
          running are called processes (as in a program that is processing something)
          and each process has a number. The kill command can be used during
          development and debugging, in a reboot scenario, or when battery is about
          to die on a laptop, it has its proper uses. As a joke, it is already bad
          enough to use the kill command on a process as it sends a TERM[inate]
          signal. As a programmer you can add a signal handler in your program, and
          then in case of TERM signal you can for example ask the user to save his
          data, the TERM signal is an advisory. The -9 sends a KILL signal. There is
          no handler for the KILL signal, there is no saving work, the process is
          destroyed by the Operating System, whatever he was working on is lost. She
          executes kill -9 95251 at <a href="https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=326">5:26</a> his code editor disappears instantly.
          <strong>Yikes!</strong></p>

        <h2>Jargon File</h2>
        <p>There is a wee bit of jargon here, but don’t worry. ESR is managing a
          jargon file you can read at
          <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/go01.html">http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/go01.html</a> and he has a cool
          <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">HOWTO</a> on hackers from which I quote below:</p>
        <p><strong>What Is a Hacker?</strong></p>
        <p>There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and
          networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the
          first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments. The
          members of this culture originated the term ‘hacker’. Hackers built the
          Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today. Hackers
          make the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this culture, if you have
          contributed to it and other people in it know who you are and call you a
          hacker, you’re a hacker.</p>
        <p>The hacker mind-set is not confined to this software-hacker culture. There
          are people who apply the hacker attitude to other things, like electronics
          or music — actually, you can find it at the highest levels of any science
          or art. Software hackers recognize these kindred spirits elsewhere and may
          call them ‘hackers’ too — and some claim that the hacker nature is really
          independent of the particular medium the hacker works in.</p>
        <p>There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but
          aren’t. These are people (mainly adolescent males, and little girls) who
          get a kick out of breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system.
          Real hackers call these people ‘crackers’ and want nothing to do with them.
          Real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not very
          bright, and object that being able to break security doesn’t make you a
          hacker any more than being able to hotwire cars makes you an automotive
          engineer. Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled into
          using the word ‘hacker’ to describe crackers; this irritates real hackers
          no end.</p>
        <p>The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break them.”</p>
