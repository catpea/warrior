The Highschooler is an expansion of the &quot;Notes from an Imaginary High School&quot;. Both chapters still need work, some of the more the spicy parts need to be flattened out. I added 8 new life changing videos. And I discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxRTHq5uBbg">another Mad World that someone made out of Breakfast Club</a>, I added that too. I also added <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1Nq086QB1Q">Gary Jules</a> next to Izzie Naylor in <a href="the-musician.html">The Musician</a>.</p>

(Ma-ma-ma-ma... oh-### to-to, ma-ma-ma-ma, Oh-to-to-to, I used to think that video was probably for real, just that Japanese culture was so odd - Oof.)</p>

        <p>I originally somewhat planned to add &quot;The Inventor&quot; as a precursor to The Founder but Bret Victor, Chase Lewis and Ann Makosinski are not just inventors, or rather we are all inventors and as with Genius it is not that big of a deal. They are Students and a Programmer, so I added them along with a few others to existing chapters. I haven&#39;t left much room between <a href="the-courageous.html">The Courageous</a> and <a href="the-visionary.html">The Visionary</a> The Inventor would not fit there very well. In addition I moved the Learning Toolkit (Mind/Concept Mapping) from Visionary to The Courageous adding <a href="https://readwise.io/">Readwise</a> and <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> (as examples of learning tools), as unique visions of the future begin with real education (self-education).</p>

        <h3 id="march-6th-2020-92244-pm">March 6th 2020, 9:22:44 pm</h3>
        <p>Added <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFDG7w_jAFk">Ann Makosinski</a> and her more Student/Schooling focused <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw4FzMDhU6M">Introduction by Forbes</a> to <a href="the-student.html">The Student</a>.</p>

        <p>Added <a href="http://profithunt.co/">Profit Hunt</a> (and mentioned Requests for Startups again) at the bottom of <a href="the-founder.html">The Founder</a> (MRR means Monthly Recurring Revenue).</p>
        <h3 id="march-6th-2020-85244-pm">March 6th 2020, 8:52:44 pm</h3>

        <p>Updated <a href="the-courageous.html">The Courageous</a> with the tiny &quot;Article One&quot;. I hope someday this will grow to become a Universal Declaration of Student Rights, that a student who is not yet ready to voice her or his opinions can hold up in class as a symbol and reminder. Where we ask teachers to step away until they show that they are capable of helping and not interfering, with Real Education.</p>
        <h3 id="february-28th-2020-103248-pm">February 28th 2020, 10:32:48 pm</h3>

        <h3 id="february-28th-2020-90502-pm">February 28th 2020, 9:05:02 pm</h3>
        <p>Created [and begun work on a] new chapter <a href="the-courageous.html">The Courageous</a>, I just finished the abstract narrative and settled on a format for a list of Beautiful Audio-books by adding the first book. As a side-note I also added a couple more fantasy and Ides images to <a href="the-genius.html">The Genius</a> in hopes of reminding the readers of the Beauty &amp; Might of Storytelling.</p>
