Academic Development can't succeed on its own, it is incompatible with who
we are, we are not machines that can make room for knowledge on our
long-term storage drive. Even with a blooming ecosystem of Memory Palaces,
that which is irrelevant to out Hearts and Existence will be soon forgotten.

This parade through classes, levels, and subjects is a waste of time. Our
time is precious, life is so dear. There simply is no time for charades.

Principal, stand up, and deliver.
