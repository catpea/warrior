It hurts my heart to say this lovely woman is doing something wrong.

As a Professional Pianist, she is brilliant, but as a teacher, she is a
Destroyer of Hopes.

Don't listen to a word she says.

Watch her hands.

She is using both of them.

Her left hand is creating low-frequency sounds, and she almost never does
anything there, and she keeps things simple. She is almost doing drums with
her left hand, she is laying down the beat.

Ignore her left hand, now.

Look at her right hand, at first she goes up and down. Then she does the
pinky & thumb, but still, even though she is playing notes apart, see it as
one note, pay attention to thumb only. She does jump between keys, but it
is rare and masked by her left hand that is doing the beat.

The keys she presses at the same time with her right hand should be seen as
one key, she is just mixing two sounds together to create a third sound.
When she presses two keys at the same time, she is adding a third key.

Why add keys to the piano. Because two keys at the same time sounds richer
than pressing one key.

Making a single sound out of pressing multiple keys at the same time, is
called making a chord. Chords are multiple notes played at the same time,
for the purpose of enriching the complexity of what you hear.

Left hand does the simple beat, it must always be simple.

Right hand does the melody, slowly goes up and down, in this particular
video chords aside, she only skips one key to get to the next note.

All of this is obscured, because she was taught Music Theory compatible
with Mozart & Chopin.

You are being taught to break out. Chords are beautiful for sure, but, you
just use the recording (the sound sample a .wav/mp3 of the chord) and focus
on composition.

Melodies are not made by learning how to play a piano. They are made in
[LMMS][1] by gently moving up and down.
