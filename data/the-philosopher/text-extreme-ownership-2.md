Extreme Ownership of Your Education, simply means **Self Education**. It
means learning at your own pace, by your own means, in a sequence that
matches you the best. This is also the meaning of the opening quote by Sun
Tzu _“Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated
warriors go to war first and then seek to win.”_

Education is not about GPA, diploma, or career. It is about growing up, it
is about being healthy, and strong. Regardless of where you are headed,
whether or not that direction includes Medical School, or a University. You
need to Self Educate before sitting down in those classrooms. A classroom
may not be the place where you find knowledge, not always, not reliably.

Setting off on an endless Audiobook Adventure, to last you many years, or
even decades, is probably the most illustrative example I can fit in a
sentence. Astra Taylor, the woman behind the unacceptable [Zizek!][1],
[Examined Life][2], and now [Democracy][3] further explains, and I think
serves as an example of what it means to Self Educate.
