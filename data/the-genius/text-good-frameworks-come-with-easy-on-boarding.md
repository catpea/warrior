Easy On-boarding means easy access to eventual mastery. It means
progressive, gradual learning and mastery.

It would be difficult, though not impossible, to learn to write words
without knowing the alphabet. English, or as I call it here "The English
Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication" bonds really well with
our ability to learn words as a baby. The language evolved with human
learning abilities. If English words were presented without letters, it
would still be a functional, but very different language.

Fundamentally, a framework without easy on-boarding, or progressive
adaptation features is kind of useless. If there is no way to learn
something, it won't be learned.

But overall, new on-boarding can be tacked on to something that previously
had trouble with it. For example in [God Created the Integers: The
Mathematical Breakthroughs That Changed History][1] Stephen Hawking helped
his memory by creating a history of evolution of mathematical thinking. I
view the book as a [Memory Palace][2] with emphasis on historical dates and
progression, that expands standard mathematical on-boarding and helps the
reader to a greater initial spectrum of Mathematics.
