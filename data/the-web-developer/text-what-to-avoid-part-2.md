Shopify is the world’s fastest growing commerce platform and we have no
plans to slow down! The Shopify Theme Partnerships team is on a mission to
make sure our merchants have access to the highest quality themes
available. Every month, thousands of merchants look for new themes for
their online stores. Our team is on the lookout for skilled, passionate
designers and developers we can work with to create amazing themes for the
Theme Store.

##### Important information to know before you apply

Here are a few things to consider before you send us your Theme Partner
application:

*   Shopify themes need constant care and attention. We expect Theme
Partners who work with us to be engaged, passionate about their theme(s),
and apply any theme updates we request in a timely manner.
*   Being a Theme Partner is a full-time job. You will need to dedicate a
lot of time updating your theme(s) as well as supporting the merchants who
are using your theme. If you become a Theme Partner, you’ll need to
consider how you’ll balance Theme Partner work with other jobs you are
currently doing, or are planning to be engaged in.
*   Our current Theme Partners are a tight-knit group of people. We expect
potential Theme Partners to be approachable and collaborative with the
Shopify Theme Partnerships team, as well as merchants using your theme(s).
*   We want Theme Partners to actively contribute to the Shopify themes
ecosystem, and work with us to help merchants succeed. The Theme
Partnerships team will be working closely with you every step of the way
during the theme submission process, and will continue to work closely with
you once your theme is published. We have dedicated email and Slack
channels set up to provide feedback, advice and support for all your
theme-related questions and issues.
*   The revenue share for Theme Partners is 70/30. The Theme Partner
receives 70% of each theme sale.

##### What to submit when you apply

Please email themes\@shopify.com and include all of the following:

1.  A link to an active Shopify website you built for a client. This must
be a live, fully functioning shop that you built for a client.
2.  A case study for the above Shopify website that details your
experiences on the project. You will need to provide an overview of the
project and the client.
3.  A cover letter.
4.  A link to your design portfolio.

##### How we review your application

For the **active Shopify website** our review will cover:

*   Problem solving ability (the solution outlined in the case study is
visible).
*   Originality (the shop is using a custom theme, not a free or paid theme
from the Shopify Theme Store).
*   Art direction (choice of photography, images, icons, color, and overall
originality).
*   Layout (flow of content, hierarchy, balance, contrast, white space,
responsiveness, grid, and alignment).
*   Typography (font pairings, font sizes, line spacing, hierarchy of text,
number of fonts used, and legibility of text).
*   Consistency in design patterns (between pages and on a single page).
*   Accessibility (hover states, colour ratios, and touch targets).
*   Customer UX (purchase flow through the collection, product, and cart
pages).
*   Technical ability (up-to-date with Shopify platform, website
functionality, code consistency, and lack of errors).

For the **case study** we will be looking for you to provide this
information:

*   What brought the client to you?
*   What were the client’s needs?
*   How did you go about solving their problem?
*   We would like to see your research, your workflow (prototyping and
refining), and what you learned.

For the **cover letter** we would like to see the following information:

*   An outline of who you (and your team) are.
*   Why you want to join the Shopify Theme Partner community?
*   Why you think you’d do well as a Theme Partner?

Feel free to put your own personal touch or spin on the cover letter. We
highly value originality, enthusiasm, and motivation when considering
applications.

For the **design portfolio** we will be reviewing the same design related
points as mentioned above for the active Shopify website:

*   Art direction.
*   Layout.
*   Typography.
*   Consistency.

The Shopify Theme Partnerships team is not able to provide detailed
feedback on why an application does not pass our review process. If we do
reach out to you about becoming a potential Theme Partner, we will work
with you on the next steps of the approval process.

##### Your theme in the Shopify Theme Store

Once a theme has been built and approved, it may only be distributed via
the Theme Store. Please do not distribute your theme on other marketplaces
or third-party channels, or try to take customers away from the Theme Store.

##### Theme support

If there is a technical issue with your theme (for example: broken layout,
dead link, logic error) you will be responsible for fixing the issue in a
timely fashion. Critical bugs must be fixed immediately or your theme may
be temporarily removed from the Theme Store.

Theme Partners are responsible for supporting merchants who use their
theme(s). You will need to provide a public support email address, theme
documentation, and assist merchants with their theme-related questions.

Themes will be removed from the Theme Store if they have made less than 25
sales in a 3 month time period. Theme Partners are responsible for keeping
their themes up-to-date with core Shopify features and any improved
standards Shopify implements in the future. These can include improvements
to the overall user experience, the user interface, accessibility, and more.
