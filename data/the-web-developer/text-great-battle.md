Becoming a Web Developer is like fighting in a Great Battle.

If you make a wrong move, **you will lose**, but gain wisdom for it, with
each failure you gain more wisdom, with each rebuild, you build faster.

Things can get toxic all too quickly, you will have to be ready to quit,
and retry. Like a Samurai, without thought, you release your Katana, cut
the job, move on.
