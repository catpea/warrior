Some years from now we will accept the challenge that Michelle Alexander
put us to, and we will learn to look ahead far enough to begin to put many
more things right.

In great part because of you, my Dear Reader. Because you will raise your
children, with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights high up on the
wall. Both as a sacred document, and as an aim for your child to grow up
high enough, to make lasting contributions to, a reminder that growing up,
is not optional.

My Dear Heroes, here in US, a state law that goes against federal law is
null and void. It is my hope that some day, a much more powerful Universal
Declaration of Human Rights may render both State and Federal laws null and
void. We are one family, one people.

I ask you to build homes with the belief that [the inherent dignity and
equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family are the
foundation of freedom, justice and peace in all of the world][1], because
our humanity depends on everyoneâ€™s humanity.
