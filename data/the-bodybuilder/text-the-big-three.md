The workout consists of three complementary exercises arranged in a way
that I don’t have to stop.

1.  [Dumbbell Lateral Raise][1]
2.  [Standing Dumbbell Curls][2]
3.  [Overhead Shoulder Press][3]

Combined with dancing, which in this context is a form of stretching that
doubles as a cardio workout.

Good examples of fine workout songs are [Blade’s Blood Rave][4] for fast
cardio and [Blanco Brown’s The Git Up][5] for rest and some stretching.

I find it really helpful to add sugar to my workout water, but I am sure
candy works just as well. Sweetened water (sometimes V8 tomato juice) and
good music are the two things that I find most helpful during my routine.

In weight lifting there maybe difficult discomfort 5 – 10 lifts into some
routine, then you switch to some other exercise (for example from [Standing
Dumbbell Curls][6] to [Overhead Shoulder Press][7] where your biceps rest
while you perform the shoulder press), you never sit, you never lie, you
use both arms, both legs, you don’t stop to rest. **If you need to stop
then your weights are too heavy**, and your workout is not working out.

Start in the beginning, come to the end, and then stop. Start with 3.5lb
per hand, even if out of humility, even if just to remind yourself that you
always start in the beginning, and you always finish what you start.
