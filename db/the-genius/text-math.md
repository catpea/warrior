Math is almost too easy to bother with, it is certainly too messy when
compared to the exquisite and wonderfully unambiguous and vast world of
programming.

Basic programming is enough to visualize all the important things in
mathematics.

[Math as Code][1]

It was only ever intimidating because it is a primitive language meant for
paper and pencil, with an ugly problem to boot. As [Math as Code][2] notes
"Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author,
context and the field of study (linear algebra, set theory, etc)."

It can be a wonderful and enlightening adventure to visit works of Newton
from the simple world of programming, but to teach Calculus on paper is to
waste your time on trivialities of a simple loop.

Let us face that today's "Alphabet of Math" is basic Programming. This is
because programming notation is not as ambiguous, and it is easier to
latch-on-to-and-pursue mathematical concepts, as trivial as they will turn
out to be to you now.

As an enormous bonus, at the end of the day you can see your new knowledge
come to life with a simple, mathematically themed program like [P5js][3] or
maybe [D3][4], or even [SVG][5] (keep it in sync with leading Web
Technologies as they receive most attention and thus good programming,
exposure, use, and as a bonus bring a solid measure of fair employment
opportunities).

Some are moved by Ides, others by Numbers. As numbers can now come to life
when transitioning from dead paper to colorful screens, games,
visualizations.
