Look a the ease with which Karlie Kloss teaches real, live, moving,
interactive, Modern Math to children.

It is not just Drag and Drop programming, with works like [Math as Code][1]
children who enjoy it, get access to Theoretical Physics and Abstract
Mathematics. A child using the program that [Karlie teaches with][2] will
see little surface difference between making a rectangle and converting
matter to energy via Einstein's E=mcÂ². A venture into the function
contents, which are not too complex as shown in the previous video, may
perhaps create a new Einstein, change the World, or Time, or better yet,
[both][3].

In this short clip she interjects the use of variables and dynamic
calculation; as a result she creates a reusable function that creates
rectangles with a base twice the height.

For many this is a mind blowing lesson that will call to them, pull them
into the world of Math, Computers, Science, Technology.

[Kode With Klossy][4] shows what these classes are like. What real education looks like, where teachers strive to be worthy of teaching their students.
