A command is a program made easy to execute. In other words by turning a
program into a command, the programmer standardizes the execution and
customization of the program.

Usually programs need compilation, or an interpreter, they need some
libraries. Often programs may need to be configured somehow, be it a
configuration file, or just editing code. Programs may be hard to run,
because every program is different.

When a programmer decides to turn his program into a command, something
wonderful happens. The programmer adds a bunch of stuff to his program to
make it into a command, and thus _standardizes_ the way the program is ran
and customized.
