I was unable to locate the coffeemaker from the story. Personally I'd just
stick a [Raspberry PI][1] into a cheap one and make my own sys command
(with proper argument parsing).

If you are courageous enough to do this, might as well install a small web
server, [stream the coffeemaker][2] using the [camera board module][3], and
let people brew you one for a small [fee of $9.95][4] while you [blog about
the experience][5] on the PI it self.
