Creating sounds with a synthesizer can be tiring, not every sound you
synthesize will be ground breaking. Back in the old days, listeners were
not too happy with synthesized songs, people would actually call them UFO
Sounds.

Some choose to skip sound synthesis and create/[download][1] samples.
Samples can be replayed at different frequencies, depending on which piano
key you hit. In fact if you record a single piano key, you can almost
recreate the piano entirely by replaying that one piano key at different
frequencies/notes (A note like _middle C_, is just a named frequency, in
this case 261.63 Hz.)

[Sampling][2] is the art of borrowing a sound, or even a little bit of a song (as in Lofi Hip Hop) and frequently replaying it at a different frequency. You can also sample sounds around you to create unique drums, [hats][3], even piano or some lo-tech violin out of [flinging a doorstop][4]. You can give beatboxing a try and build a song out of sampling/splicing the instruments you imitated with your own voice.

Downloadable Drumkits, are collections of short samples of instruments
taken from various places, including other songs. Visit [r/Drumkits][5] for
some free downloads.

Additionally, [freesound][6] has a huge library, and [Splice][7] has a well
organized one aimed at musicians for $7.99/mo (the free trial is worth it).
