[Zeno][1] was the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy, which he taught in Athens from about 300 BC. Based on the moral ideas of the Cynics, Stoicism laid great emphasis on goodness and peace of mind gained from living a life of Virtue in accordance with Nature.

According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for
humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not
allowing oneself to be controlled by whim, the desire for pleasure, or fear
of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to do one’s part
in nature’s plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and
justly.

Stoicism would have influenced the Roman Soldier.
