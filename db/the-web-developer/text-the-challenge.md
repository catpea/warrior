Now, a job making themes for Shopify is great for a Web Design start-up
struggling to get customers, as 160 sales would get them $20K, after the
30% cut (of $8,640). But for an outsider looking in, it is just a look into
the world of professional web development, and never-ending bug fixing.
Aside from regular bugs, both code-bases (bootstrap and shopify) are under
active development, that is a lot of code updates.

There is a smaller but streamlined theme sales platform, with [more
reasonable restrictions][1]. Take a look at the sales stats that they
parade right at their [front page][2]. At 48,623 sales priced at $44 USD,
the [INSPINIA - Responsive Admin Theme][3] would have made 2.2 million USD.
Even if WrapBootstrap took 50% of that, the developer took a million home.

Now remember [INSPINIA][4] is sitting right on top of [Bootstrap][5] so
[all this development is going on in the back][6] at no charge to [INSPINIA
Developers][7]. All they do is add more components, and keep up with the
latest updates to the [Bootstrap][8] code base.
