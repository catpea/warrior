A bright new JavaScript compiler/framework named [Svelte][1] (28.2k github
stars) has recently entered the battle area.

Previously [Vue.js][2] (154k stars) outcompeted Facebook's [React][3] (141k
stars).

Svelte offers a [framework for building web applications][4], and an
[approach to building mobile apps][5] as well.

If you are going to start programming, start with [Svelte][6].
