I am upgrading the theme, there were some problems with [Edward Tufte CSS][1] so I switched to [Pico CSS][2] for now. As a result the book can read your browser settings, and if your operating system is in dark-mode the website will appear dark as well. There is also a persistent manual override, where you can flip your mode and it will stay that way.

It is not a very tidy program I just patched Pico code, I need to rewrite that from ground up. Beyond this I need to work on the Changelog, I mangled the timestamps, I wasn't sure what to do with them, and now I have some programming to do. A lot of things are tricky here because I want this book to be archivable by robots, like [The Way Back Machine][3]. That means, no server junk, no external dependencies, no odd java-script (basically the website needs to work with JavaScript disabled.)
