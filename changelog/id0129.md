Created [The Highschooler][1] out of [The Courageous][2], and added a new chapter [The Principal][3]. The Highschooler is an expansion of the "Notes from an Imaginary High School". Both chapters still need work, some of the more the spicy parts need to be flattened out. I added 8 new life changing videos. And I discovered [another Mad World that someone made out of Breakfast Club][4], I added that too. I also added [Gary Jules][5] next to Izzie Naylor in [The Musician][6].
