I originally somewhat planned to add "The Inventor" as a precursor to The Founder but Bret Victor, Chase Lewis and Ann Makosinski are not just inventors, or rather we are all inventors and as with Genius it is not that big of a deal. They are Students and a Programmer, so I added them along with a few others to existing chapters. I haven't left much room between [The Courageous][1] and [The Visionary][2] The Inventor would not fit there very well. In addition I moved the Learning Toolkit (Mind/Concept Mapping) from Visionary to The Courageous adding [Readwise][3] and [Anki][4] (as examples of learning tools), as unique visions of the future begin with real education (self-education).
