Created a new chapter [The Urban Explorer][1].


I am going to move adding a new chapter from Friday evening to Sunday evening.

This is because I am a little bit more rested on Sundays.

If anybody is watching this, I am sorry if I am ruining your weekly plans.

But I still feel we are nearing some milestone, a possible completion of this project, maybe.

If so, I had an amazing time creating this. Thank You.


I hope for this work to become a set of lectures with an aim to help people see that we are all the same, that our differences are tiny, and we are each a Mighty Genius and a Great Adventurer.


Could you make a project similar to this?
Could you help the world grow as well, Dear Reader.

I also publish and narrate poetry on https://catpea.com/ I am up to 194 poems at the time of this note.


All good things come to a point where they must transform into something greater,  
Thank You.
