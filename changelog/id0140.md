It took hours to sort out issues with the CHANGELOG, I ended up creating a [database with records][1], then the [HTML website version][2], and a [GitHub version][3] as well. I added the "ago" timestamps, and set them update live.

I used jQuery, for the time-agos, I'll guess I'll use it for the color/theme switcher as well. jQuery is getting old, but the time-ago feature took only [ten lines of code][4] that's hard to do with pure [DOM functions][5].
