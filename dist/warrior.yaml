      text: >-
        <p><a href="audio/id145.mp3">Listen</a></p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>A Warrior is She that thrives and triumphs where’er She be.</p>

        <p>You cannot be broken, you must use your misfortune to light your
        way.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>You can learn anything you want, there are no smarter.</p>

        <p>They are just actors, with a handful of fragile lessons, crafted to
        impress.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>There is nothing that can break you, there are no stronger.</p>

        <p>Look to the source of the pain, it comes from Innocence.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>Nothing rooted in Innocence is ugly, all lessons that come from being
        tricked,</p>

        <p>add up to make you more beautiful, enable your insight and foresight,
        and fuel your authenticity.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>When the regrets come at night, that&#39;s just you brain asking
        you,</p>

        <p>to think harder, to comprehend your beauty in full,</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>No one can trick you, not for long enough. So, don&#39;t be
        scared.</p>

        <p>Memoirs, Audio-books, Lectures will show you how many better people
        there are.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>We all have to Enlarge our Worlds daily.</p>

        <p>Audiobooks, and Lectures, will show you that all you have met thus
        far were just the same type of person.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>Do not be afraid to rise.</p>

        <p>The people, or person you have long though about, exist.</p>

        <p>But before they can see you, you have to rise, and shine, and be
        seen.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>Don&#39;t be scared.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>Those who will use your Love, Innocence, Endurance and Generosity
        against you,</p>

        <p>have long been lost, they are blinded, and fractured, and damaged,
        and broken.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>They hold no power over you.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>If their attacks continue they will grind themselves to dust,</p>

        <p>and all the experiences that will be left in their wake, will make
        you stronger and better.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>Battles make you stronger, smarter, more beautiful.</p>

        <p>You are a Warrior, that&#39;s the oldest name for it.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>A Warrior is She that uses the harm that came her way as energy,</p>

        <p>who understands none can stay a child and all must grow, and enlarge
        their worlds.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>A Warrior can never be damaged, or hurt -- a Warrior Learns.</p>

        <p>A Warrior resists tears in the rain, just like she can resist
        weakness.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>We live in a fragile world, full of fragile people, with fragile
        egos,</p>

        <p>they speak fragile advice, with fragile words; from their fragile
        hills.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>A Warrior does not wait to be taught.</p>

        <p>A Warrior learns fastest on her own.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>Learn in the sequence that fits you best,</p>

        <p>learn at the pace that helps you most.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>Push the dark imaginings back,</p>

        <p>and rise.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>Move your hand.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>And push up.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>And stand up.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>Get ready to walk,</p>

        <p>and then run, day, after day, slightly longer.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>And then lift your weights, the way you learned to run,</p>

        <p>and then lift for longer,
          and never rest.</p>
        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>And then, with your sweetest audio-book.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>Step.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>Step Up.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>Rise Up.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>To No End.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>This is The Life Of A Warrior.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>Nothing Can Crush You,</p>

        <p>Nothing Can Hold You.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>Don&#39;t You See?</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>Everything Makes You Stronger,</p>

        <p>Everything Makes You Fight Longer.</p>

        <p><br><br></p>

        <p>You,</p>

        <p>Are A Warrior.</p>

        <p>Don&#39;t aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a
        target, the more
          you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued;
          it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one&#39;s
          personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of
          one&#39;s surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and
          the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about
          it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go
          on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see
          that in the long-run - in the long-run, I say! - success will follow you
          precisely because you had forgotten to think about it.</p>

        <p>Warrior is the oldest name for it. Since our days in Africa we have
          progressed forward and the word has evolved many times.</p>
        <p>At each stage there are strong lessons to be learned, directly, or
          indirectly.</p>
        <p>Whatever your calling, wherever you break away to make your stand,
        even if
          you fail to reach the top of your mountain, know that you will surely reach
          the rays of the sun, know that you will become part of the Great Family of
          Heroes, know that countless many will follow, and that your footsteps will
          become a well worn path, in time.</p>
        <p>The lessons come from Philosophers, Scientists, Thinkers, Soldiers,
          Presidents, Athletes, Mercenaries, Murphy’s Law, Mighty Little Girls &amp;
          Young Ladies, Mothers, Sisters, Brothers, and Fathers. From empathy and
          compassion, joy and tragedy, triumph and disaster, and great challenges
          like learning to live and grieve at the same time, or standing with the
          demonized, disposable, or voiceless.</p>
        <p>The lessons come from, Choosing Life.</p>

        <p>To progress forward, we must be ready to learn to understand by
        subtle
          analogy from all other theories. Theories of survival, of living above the
          common levels of life, of choosing heroism, choosing greatness. Striving to
          thrive, rising to impossible challenges, learning to overcome pain and
          suffering, and standing upon the shoulders of giants to lead the way for
          others to follow.</p>

        <p>My Grandma taught me to ask &quot;Quo Vadis?&quot; it is from Latin,
        it means
          &quot;Whither goest thou?&quot; or &quot;Where are you going?&quot;.</p>
        <p>At 3:41 the brave mercenary describes himself as someone who was
          &quot;Programmed to Destroy&quot;. While he was growing in his wisdom, he perceived
          the lack of it, as &quot;being programmed&quot;. There is an old saying &quot;A learned
          servant is not a useful servant&quot;, wisdom set Mr. Mander free.</p>
        <p>Quo Vadis? is a repeating decision making pattern among the great
        beings.
          Mr. Mander in what he calls his &quot;True Act of Bravery&quot; (3:49). Uses it to
          &quot;ensure [that] there&#39;ll never be separation between who I am, and what I
          do&quot;, to ensure his Authenticity, Harmony, Dignity, Integrity, Sanity. He
          also asks &quot;Quo Vadis?&quot; in the larger question surrounding both &quot;Does that
          elephant need its face more than some guy in Asia needs a tusk on his
          desk?&quot; and &quot;Would I be brave enough to give up everything in my life to try
          and stop the suffering of animals&quot;. The result of these Authentic Brave
          Queries is the <a href="https://www.iapf.org/">International Anti-Poaching Foundation</a>. From Mercenary,
          to a Warrior, a Legend, a Great Being.</p>
        <p>Lucy Hone is yet another Great Being who employs this type of

        the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy, which he taught in Athens
        from about 300 BC. Based on the moral ideas of the Cynics, Stoicism laid
        great emphasis on goodness and peace of mind gained from living a life
        of Virtue in accordance with Nature.</p>

        <p>According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness
        for
          humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not
          allowing oneself to be controlled by whim, the desire for pleasure, or fear
          of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to do one’s part

        charming features. She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a
        swordswoman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a
        demon or a god, mounted or on foot. She handled unbroken horses with
        superb skill; she rode unscathed down perilous descents. Whenever a
        battle was imminent, Yoshinaka sent her out as his first captain,
        equipped with strong armor, an oversized sword, and a mighty bow; and
        she performed more deeds of valor than any of his other warriors.</p>

        <p>Where a Hunter had to be a hunter or perish, becoming a soldier was
        almost
          optional. A soldier needed training, skill and wisdom to survive into
          retirement. A soldier, also needed a tribe as not to live in isolation.</p>
        <p>It is in the wisdom of warriors returning from hell of war, that we
        find
          hard earned inspiration and strength; because there isn&#39;t a soldier that
          does not ask &quot;Why am I in hell?&quot;.</p>
        <p>One of the most important lessons to take away from this, is that a

          is saved inside out, not outside in.</p>

      text: >-
        <p>A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise;
        nothing
          ruffles the equanimity of his spirit. In the heat of battle he remains
          cool; in the midst of catastrophes he keeps level his mind. Earthquakes do
          not shake him, he laughs at storms. We admire him as truly great, who, in
          the menacing presence of danger or death, retains his self-possession; who,
          for instance, can compose a poem under impending peril or hum a strain in
          the face of death. Such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing or in
          the voice, is taken as an infallible index of a large nature - of what we
          call a capacious mind, which, far from being pressed or crowded, has always
          room for something more.</p>

      title: Eight virtues of Bushido
      text: >-
        <h3 id="righteousness">Righteousness</h3>

        <p>Be acutely honest throughout your dealings with all people. Believe
        in
          justice, not from other people, but from yourself. To the true warrior, all
          points of view are deeply considered regarding honesty, justice and
          integrity. Warriors make a full commitment to their decisions.</p>
        <h3 id="heroic-courage">Heroic Courage</h3>

        <p>Hiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all. A true warrior
        must
          have heroic courage. It is absolutely risky. It is living life completely,
          fully and wonderfully. Heroic courage is not blind. It is intelligent and
          strong.</p>
        <h3 id="benevolence-compassion">Benevolence, Compassion</h3>

        <p>Through intense training and hard work the true warrior becomes quick
        and
          strong. They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be used
          for good. They have compassion. They help their fellow men at every
          opportunity. If an opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to
          find one.</p>
        <h3 id="respect">Respect</h3>

        <p>True warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do not need to prove
        their
          strength. Warriors are not only respected for their strength in battle, but
          also by their dealings with others. The true strength of a warrior becomes
          apparent during difficult times.</p>
        <h3 id="integrity">Integrity</h3>

        <p>When warriors say that they will perform an action, it is as good as
        done.
          Nothing will stop them from completing what they say they will do. They do
          not have to ‘give their word’. They do not have to ‘promise’. Speaking and
          doing are the same action.</p>
        <h3 id="honour">Honour</h3>

        <p>Warriors have only one judge of honor and character, and this is
          themselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are carried out are
          a reflection of whom they truly are. You cannot hide from yourself.</p>
        <h3 id="duty-and-loyalty">Duty and Loyalty</h3>

        <p>Warriors are responsible for everything that they have done and
        everything
          that they have said, and all of the consequences that follow. They are
          immensely loyal to all of those in their care. To everyone that they are
          responsible for, they remain fiercely true.</p>
        <h3 id="self-control">Self-Control</h3>

        <p>Warriors feel more than others. This calmness of behavior and
        composure of
          mind is rooted in the choice of endurance without a groan, wisdom over
          ignorance, understanding over confrontation, love over anger, and
          unbreakability in the face of suffering and loneliness.</p>

        <p>And one of the lessons we learn from this text is that &quot;A human
        being is
          more than the worst thing they have ever done.&quot;</p>
        <p>There is a class of soldier that is a product of their environment.

          are an emergent property of poverty. Maximization of survival, leads to the

      title: IF
      author: Rudyard Kipling
      text: |-
        <p>IF you can keep your head when all about you</p>
        <p>Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,</p>
        <p>If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,</p>
        <p>But make allowance for their doubting too;</p>
        <p>If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,</p>
        <p>Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,</p>
        <p>Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,</p>
        <p>And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:</p>
        <p>If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;</p>
        <p>If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;</p>
        <p>If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster</p>
        <p>And treat those two impostors just the same;</p>
        <p>If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken</p>
        <p>Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,</p>
        <p>Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,</p>
        <p>And stoop and build ‘em up with worn-out tools:</p>
        <p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings</p>
        <p>And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,</p>
        <p>And lose, and start again at your beginnings</p>
        <p>And never breathe a word about your loss;</p>
        <p>If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew</p>
        <p>To serve your turn long after they are gone,</p>
        <p>And so hold on when there is nothing in you</p>
        <p>Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’</p>
        <p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,</p>
        <p>Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,</p>
        <p>if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,</p>
        <p>If all men count with you, but none too much;</p>
        <p>If you can fill the unforgiving minute</p>
        <p>With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,</p>
        <p>Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,</p>
        <p>And - which is more - you’ll be a Man, my son!</p>

        <p>To those of you who retain some remnant of dignity and the will to
        live
          your lives for yourselves, you have the chance to make the same choice.
          Examine your values and understand that you must choose one side or the
          other. Any compromise between good and evil only hurts the good and helps
          the evil.</p>
        <p>If you&#39;ve understood what I&#39;ve said, stop supporting your
        destroyers.</p>

        <p>Don&#39;t accept their philosophy.</p>

        <p>Your destroyers hold you by means of your endurance, your generosity,
        your
          innocence, and your love.</p>
        <p>Don&#39;t exhaust yourself to help build the kind of world that you
        see around
          you now.</p>
        <p>In the name of the best within you, don&#39;t sacrifice the world to
        those who
          will take away your happiness for it.</p>

      text: >-
        <p>Go placidly amid the noise and haste,</p>

        <p>and remember what peace there may be in silence.</p>

        <p>As far as possible without surrender</p>

        <p>be on good terms with all persons.</p>

        <p>Speak your truth quietly and clearly;</p>

        <p>and listen to others,</p>

        <p>even the dull and the ignorant;</p>

        <p>they too have their story.</p>

        <p>Avoid loud and aggressive persons,</p>

        <p>they are vexations to the spirit.</p>

        <p>If you compare yourself with others,</p>

        <p>you may become vain and bitter;</p>

        <p>for always there will be greater and lesser persons than
        yourself.</p>

        <p>Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.</p>

        <p>Keep interested in your own career, however humble;</p>

        <p>it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.</p>

        <p>Exercise caution in your business affairs;</p>

        <p>for the world is full of trickery.</p>

        <p>But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;</p>

        <p>many persons strive for high ideals;</p>

        <p>and everywhere life is full of heroism.</p>

        <p>Be yourself.</p>

        <p>Especially, do not feign affection.</p>

        <p>Neither be cynical about love;</p>

        <p>for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment</p>

        <p>it is as perennial as the grass.</p>

        <p>Take kindly the counsel of the years,</p>

        <p>gracefully surrendering the things of youth.</p>

        <p>Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.</p>

        <p>But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.</p>

        <p>Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.</p>

        <p>Beyond a wholesome discipline,</p>

        <p>be gentle with yourself.</p>

        <p>You are a child of the universe,</p>

        <p>no less than the trees and the stars;</p>

        <p>you have a right to be here.</p>

        <p>And whether or not it is clear to you,</p>

        <p>no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.</p>

        <p>Therefore be at peace with God,</p>

        <p>whatever you conceive Him to be,</p>

        <p>and whatever your labors and aspirations,</p>

        <p>in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.</p>

        <p>With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,</p>

        <p>it is still a beautiful world.</p>

        <p>Be cheerful.</p>

        <p>Strive to be happy.</p>

          a Human Rights violation. It should be impossible to ask the legal

        <p>Poverty, plays a massive role in crime. We learn in this letter that
          opposite of poverty is justice, in other words, poverty is an injustice.
          Can we serve as an impartial juror, knowing that the defendant would likely
          not commit the crime, had they not been fractured by poverty? Every child
          has a bright future ahead, Art, Music, Ultramarathons, Astrophysics -
          goodness - Combinatorial Genomics, and Astrobiology. But poverty is
          extremely corrosive, too corrosive to handle, not only in it self, but in
          the surrounding culture that it frequently creates. Poverty is a virus
          armed with addiction, abuse, intolerance, xenophobia, violence, and dark
          blind stupidity.</p>

          more things right.</p>
        <p>In great part because of you, my Dear Reader. Because you will raise
        your
          children, with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights high up on the
          wall. Both as a sacred document, and as an aim for your child to grow up
          high enough, to make lasting contributions to, a reminder that growing up,
          is not optional.</p>
        <p>My Dear Heroes, here in US, a state law that goes against federal law
        is
          null and void. It is my hope that some day, a much more powerful Universal
          Declaration of Human Rights may render both State and Federal laws null and
          void. We are one family, one people.</p>
        <p>I ask you to build homes with the belief that <a
        href="https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html">the
        inherent dignity and
            equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family are the
            foundation of freedom, justice and peace in all of the world</a>, because

      text: >-
        <p>“Make me young again” - but you are young now, you can make most of
        it, no
          wax, because it is all ahead of you. Go, close your eyes and connect with
          your 80 year old self, and make the wish Killgore Trout did: “Make Me Young
          Again”, and open your eyes, and be young but wiser for it. Therein you will
          discover the nature of the Ultra. While we live our only life, poetically
          we live as it was countless lives already. By wiggling forward and back we
          can see where we are headed, and end up where we always wished to be.</p>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche">Friedrich
        Nietzsche</a> is asking you to review your decisions, treat them with
        more gravity, “Would you be willing to relive your life again, and
        again, and again? Or would you prefer to stay dead and if so, then you
        need to review your decision making.”:</p>

      text: >-
        <p><em>The heaviest burden: What, if some day or night, a demon were to
        steal

        after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you:</em></p>

        <p><em>This life, as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to
        live

        once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in
        it,

        but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh… must return to

        you—all in the same succession and sequence—even this spider and this

        moonlight between the trees and even this moment and I myself. The
        eternal

        hourglass of existence is turned over again and again—and you with it,

        speck of dust!</em></p>

        <p><em>Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse
        the demon

        who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when
        you

        would have answered him: “You are a god, and never have I heard anything

        more divine!”</em></p>

        <p><em>If this thought were to gain possession of you, it would change
        you as you

        are, or perhaps crush you. The question in each and every thing, “do you

        want this once more and innumerable times more?” would lie upon your

        actions as the greatest weight.</em></p>

      title: The three secrets of resilient people by Lucy Hone
    - type: quote
      author: Lucy Hone
      text: >-
        <p>&quot;Number One: Resilient people get that [terrible disasters do
        happen],
          they know that suffering is part of life, this doesn&#39;t mean they actually
          welcome it [...] just that when the tough times come they seem to know
          that suffering is part of every human existence and knowing this stops you
          from feeling discriminated against when the tough times come.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Number Two: Resilient people are really good at choosing
        carefully where
          they select their attention. They have a habit of realistically appraising
          situations, and typically managing to focus on the things that they can
          change, and somehow accept the things that they can&#39;t.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Make an intentional deliberate ongoing effort to tune in to
        what&#39;s good in
          your world.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Number Three: Resilient people ask themselves &quot;Is what
        I&#39;m doing helping
          or harming me?&quot; this is a question that&#39;s used a lot in good therapy.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Is what I&#39;m doing helping or harming me?&quot;</p>

          certainly for us. In this final chapter I will ask you to take Extreme
          Ownership of Your Education, and here is Jocko Willink explaining the
          gravity of the words Extreme Ownership.</p>

      title: Extreme Ownership
      text: >-
        <p>Extreme Ownership of Your Education, simply means <strong>Self
        Education</strong>. It
          means learning at your own pace, by your own means, in a sequence that
          matches you the best. This is also the meaning of the opening quote by Sun
          Tzu <em>“Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated
        warriors go to war first and then seek to win.”</em></p>

        <p>Education is not about GPA, diploma, or career. It is about growing
        up, it
          is about being healthy, and strong. Regardless of where you are headed,
          whether or not that direction includes Medical School, or a University. You
          need to Self Educate before sitting down in those classrooms. A classroom
          may not be the place where you find knowledge, not always, not reliably.</p>
        <p>Setting off on an endless Audiobook Adventure, to last you many
        years, or
          even decades, is probably the most illustrative example I can fit in a
          sentence. Astra Taylor, the woman behind the unacceptable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enyG430I2nk">Zizek!</a>,

          serves as an example of what it means to Self Educate.</p>

          restore the connecting lines between all the Daughters of Philosophia,
          lines lost due to the bleaching effect that categorization of knowledge,
          standardization of sequence of learning, and standardized testing causes.</p>

        It is
          your mind, your life, your growing up, your own responsibility. Above all,
          your body of knowledge has massive infuence over your private
          decision-making, over your freedom of choice, over your freedom of will.
          Decision-making is one of the most sacred things in life, and only you
          should have control over that.</p>
        <p>I urge you to forget the idea that you must be taught to learn. I
        urge you
          to accept that great responsibility yourself. You must take extreme

        <p>The widespread urban legend that one swallows a high number of
        spiders
          during sleep in one&#39;s life has no basis in reality. A sleeping person
          causes all kinds of noise and vibrations by breathing, the beating heart,
          snoring etc. all of which warn spiders of danger.</p>

        <p>Article adjustment on eyewitness report. Loftus&#39; meta-analysis on
        language
          manipulation studies suggested the phenomenon effects taking hold on the
          recall process and products of the human memory. Even the smallest
          adjustment in a question, such as the article preceding the supposed
          memory, could alter the responses. For example, having asked someone if
          they&#39;d seen &quot;the&quot; stop sign, rather than &quot;a&quot; stop sign, provided the
          respondent with a presupposition that there was a stop sign in the scene.
          This presupposition increased the number of people responding that they had
          indeed seen the stop sign.</p>

      title: False Etymologies of English Words
      text: >-
        <p>The actual origin of the phrase &quot;the whole nine yards&quot; is a
        mystery, and
          nearly all claimed explanations are easily proven false. Incorrect
          explanations include the length of machine gun belts, the capacity of
          concrete mixers (in cubic yards), various types of fabric, and many other
          explanations. All are probably false, since most rely on nine yards when
          evidence suggests that the phrase began as &quot;the whole six yards&quot;. In
          addition, the phrase has appeared in print as early as 1907, while many
          explanations require a much later origin date.</p>

      title: English Usage Misconceptions
      text: >-
        <p>Misconception: The words &quot;and&quot; and &quot;but&quot; must not
        begin a sentence. Those
          who impose this rule on themselves are following a modern English &quot;rule&quot;
          that was not used historically. Jeremy Butterfield described this perceived
          prohibition as one of &quot;the folk commandments of English usage&quot;. The Chicago
          Manual of Style says: There is a widespread belief—one with no historical
          or grammatical foundation—that it is an error to begin a sentence with a
          conjunction such as &#39;and&#39;, &#39;but&#39;, or &#39;so&#39;. In fact, a substantial
          percentage (often as many as 10 percent) of the sentences in first-rate
          writing begin with conjunctions. It has been so for centuries, and even the
          most conservative grammarians have followed this practice.</p>

        Day</a> is a popular tradition celebrated in Canada and the United
        States on February 2nd. It derives from the Pennsylvania Dutch
        superstition that if a groundhog emerging from its burrow on this day
        sees its shadow due to clear weather, it will retreat to its den and
        winter will persist for six more weeks, and if it does not see its
        shadow because of cloudiness, spring will arrive early.</p>

        <p>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front
        only
          the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to
          teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did
          not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to
          practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep
          and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like
          as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave
          close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...</p>

        <p>... So I had a manila folder, and I had a Sharpie, and I was like,
        what am
          I going to call this research?</p>
        <p>And the first words that came to my mind were
        &quot;whole-hearted&quot;</p>

        <p>These are whole-hearted people, living from this deep sense of
        worthiness.</p>

        <p>So I started looking at the data, and here&#39;s what I found:</p>

        <p>What they had in common was a sense of courage.</p>

        <p>Courage, the original definition of courage, when it first came into
        the
          English language -- it&#39;s from the Latin word &quot;cor,&quot; meaning &quot;heart&quot; -- and
          the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your
          whole heart.</p>

      text: >-
        <p>Out of the night that covers me, Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
        I
          thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul.</p>
        <p>In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud.
        Under
          the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed.</p>
        <p>Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the
        shade, And
          yet the menace of the years Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.</p>
        <p>It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the
          scroll. I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.</p>

        <p>Bodybuilding is a side-effect of something more. Like Confidence, or
          Happiness, or Success, it will ensue from pursuit of things that seem just
          out of your reach.</p>
    - type: text
      title: The Big Three
      text: >-
        <p>The workout consists of three complementary exercises arranged in a
        way
          that I don’t have to stop.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="https://youtu.be/FeJP4E4Z-PY?t=121">Dumbbell Lateral Raise</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://youtu.be/av7-8igSXTs">Standing Dumbbell Curls</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://youtu.be/Gu1t7X2yq4M?t=153">Overhead Shoulder Press</a></li>
        </ol>

        <p>Combined with dancing, which in this context is a form of stretching
        that
          doubles as a cardio workout.</p>
        <p>Good examples of fine workout songs are <a
        href="https://youtu.be/F6VJQZxeWNY">Blade’s Blood Rave</a> for fast
          cardio and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7U6AoZ27yE">Blanco Brown’s The Git Up</a> for rest and some stretching.</p>
        <p>I find it really helpful to add sugar to my workout water, but I am
        sure
          candy works just as well. Sweetened water (sometimes V8 tomato juice) and
          good music are the two things that I find most helpful during my routine.</p>
        <p>In weight lifting there maybe difficult discomfort 5 – 10 lifts into
        some
          routine, then you switch to some other exercise (for example from <a href="https://youtu.be/av7-8igSXTs">Standing
            Dumbbell Curls</a> to <a href="https://youtu.be/Gu1t7X2yq4M?t=153">Overhead Shoulder Press</a> where your biceps rest
          while you perform the shoulder press), you never sit, you never lie, you
          use both arms, both legs, you don’t stop to rest. <strong>If you need to stop
        then your weights are too heavy</strong>, and your workout is not
        working out.</p>

        <p>Start in the beginning, come to the end, and then stop. Start with
        3.5lb
          per hand, even if out of humility, even if just to remind yourself that you
          always start in the beginning, and you always finish what you start.</p>

      text: >-
        <p>There is no struggle because of music, the parts of your brain that
        are
          telling you to stop are weak. They are weaker than the beat of drums, they
          are weaker than a pretty song.</p>
        <p>Workout to the beats of songs, here is a player I eventually settled
        on:
          <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32980109852.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.4efc7ec7pkt8Ur&amp;algo_pvid=121e3087-e613-4dcc-af88-ba55a993e258&amp;algo_expid=121e3087-e613-4dcc-af88-ba55a993e258-1&amp;btsid=9e653dc7-cf62-4fce-8d37-51985af20013&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_10,searchweb201603_52">Professional MP3 HIFI Music Player</a> it costs US $24.80 it is OK, I
          think. It does not seem Professional, I think it is just because phones are
          really good these days.</p>

      title: Interval Timers
      text: >-
        <p>If you need precision use <a
        href="https://www.all8.com/tools/bpm.htm">this tool</a> to get a BPM on
        a song to make a
          playlist, and if you are still having difficulty with non-stop exercise
          despite a chain of slow songs, then use a computer to keep track of your
          rests. I used an Interval Timer from <a href="https://www.gymboss.com/">https://www.gymboss.com/</a></p>
        <p>Keep lowering that rest period until no rest is needed in your
        routine.</p>
    - type: image
      url: timer.png
      title: The Timer
      text: >-
        <p>Interval timer will vibrate on start and stop of both exercise and
        rest. It
          will count down the number of exercise-rest sequences. By gradually
          lowering rest period and increasing exercise-rest sequences you will easily
          increase your endurance.</p>
    - type: text
      title: Avoid Counting
      text: >-
        <p>Your body will trick you into stopping too early if you rely on
        counting.
          Interval Timers remove the distraction of constantly asking &quot;Is it enough&quot;,
          and help you switch to &quot;I will make it to the end&quot;.</p>
        <p>Use the beat of songs to further distract yourself from quitting. You
        will
          not gain endurance if you stop when your body begins hurting, you have to
          signal your body that is has to adapt because there is no stopping.</p>
        <p>Remember, you must signal your body that adaptation to exertion is
          required. You must not allow your body to force you to stop as that will
          void the exercise and your body will not receive any adaptation signals.</p>
        <p>No adaptation signals, no change to your strength and endurance.</p>

      title: Back Pain
      text: >-
        <p>Significant Injuries are more likely if you lift heavy. If you lift
        heavy a
          few times, your muscles will not be in a flexible enough state to handle
          it. Eventually you will pull a muscle, hurt yourself. If you lift 5lb
          10,000 times, the chances of getting hurt are much lower. Back pain is
          still likely to occur, you will need a proper bed, I use the inexpensive
          <a href="http://pragmabed.com/">PragmaBed</a></p>

      title: The Bed
      text: >-
        <p>Raising your legs, raising your upper body, curving your spine will
        let
          your body rest. A flat mattress will attempt to straighten the natural
          curve to your lower back, in combination with lifting weights for prolonged
          periods, this is a recipe for disaster. You must let your back-muscles
          relax.</p>

      title: Electrolytes
      text: >-
        <p>While our cooling is superior, we do lose electrolytes while we
        sweat, you
          need to put them back in. V8 vegetable juice which contains both sodium and
          potassium is one way to do so, but always with wisdom and in moderation.</p>
    - type: text
      title: No Rest
      text: >-
        <p>Finally we arrive to the point where I explain why you can’t take
        days off.
          Think of your body as a good horse to your mind. Take two horses with
          muscle atrophy, one walks ten steps three times, every other day weekends
          off, the other trots for eight and half hours every day for many years, no
          day off. Which horse would you bet on, which horse would have more muscle,
          which horse would live healthier?</p>

        <p>The staying in the moment that he describes can be induced with a fun
        and snappy playlist, where non-stop endurance bodybuilding is concerned.
          Ultra-marathons are different from endurance workouts, they take longer and you certainly don’t want to depend on your mp3 player to finish.

        it is just a little

      text: >-
        <p>Creating sounds with a synthesizer can be tiring, not every sound you
          synthesize will be ground breaking. Back in the old days, listeners were
          not too happy with synthesized songs, people would actually call them UFO
          Sounds.</p>
        <p>Some choose to skip sound synthesis and create/<a
        href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Drumkits/">download</a> samples.
          Samples can be replayed at different frequencies, depending on which piano
          key you hit. In fact if you record a single piano key, you can almost
          recreate the piano entirely by replaying that one piano key at different
          frequencies/notes (A note like _middle C_, is just a named frequency, in
          this case 261.63 Hz.)</p>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)">Sampling</a>
        is the art of borrowing a sound, or even a little bit of a song (as in
        Lofi Hip Hop) and frequently replaying it at a different frequency. You
        can also sample sounds around you to create unique drums, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-hat">hats</a>, even piano or some
        lo-tech violin out of <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS4gZcjSHk4">flinging a
        doorstop</a>. You can give beatboxing a try and build a song out of
        sampling/splicing the instruments you imitated with your own voice.</p>

        <p>Downloadable Drumkits, are collections of short samples of
        instruments
          taken from various places, including other songs. Visit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Drumkits/">r/Drumkits</a> for

      text: >-
        <p>Please remember what Claudio teaches us. A song is a story, it is not
        the
          back-beat, not the piano, not the twelve inch drum, or the bass head. A
          song is a story told with voice and music.</p>
        <p>Grab a pencil, draw a line. Mark all the important events along the
        line.
          That&#39;s where the lyrics start or end, that&#39;s where the back-beat slows or
          picks up, that&#39;s where your listeners will start to laugh or start to cry.</p>
        <p>We compose music, because the greatest of stories cannot be expressed
        in
          words.</p>

        <p>You don&#39;t need to know musical notation.</p>

        <p>Musical notation has been replaced by a SAVE BUTTON.</p>

        <p>No, you do not need to know Musical Notation to read Chopin&#39;s
        Nocturnes,
          either.</p>
        <p>You just import the midi file into lmms, and gaze. He is not smarter
        than
          you, he just sat at a piano making melodies, wrote them down arranged them
          in a song, and became famous for having picked nice ones.</p>
        <p>(Don&#39;t listen to people telling you that you can&#39;t become a
        World Famous
          Maestro, because you don&#39;t know notes. They are just salty because they had
          to learn them, and you don&#39;t.)</p>
        <p>Like languages, music evolved to match our abilities. Everyone is a
          composer. The rules are very simple.</p>
        <p>Drums must be low and simple one or two keys. When making melodies
        don&#39;t
          jump around, transition from one nearby key to another, they are grouped to
          sound nice together. Break the rules from time to time.</p>

        <p>Look how keys go together, only when melody gets too boring, is there
        a
          huge shift, a kind of a bridge, to get you to the next melody.</p>
        <p>Notice the Intro, the song does not really start until Ralph Wiggum
        ends up
          wearing Jebediah Springfield&#39;s Head as a hat.</p>
        <p>Look how the song has quick melodies, followed by longer key presses,
        and
          quick little melodies again. This way none of the parts get boring, and the
          song keeps going.</p>
        <p>Notice the Outro. The moment Matt Groening name is displayed, a new
          variation pops up, and it is a melody that has a very nice closure at the
          end. It does not seem to leave off unfinished, it hits those four final
          notes in a sequence, and you know it is done, and done.</p>

        <p>Drums do beat.</p>

        <p>Beat is what your foot does when you like a song. There will be a
        rhythm
          within a song almost always represented by a drum kit. A low deep sound
          with some stuff happening behind it. That stuff behind it is the drum kit.</p>
        <p>Listen, The Drum Kit, is just an instrument. If it was just the
        drums, it
          would be like a piano with one key. There is more to drums, there are some
          quick sharp sounding things that go along with it.</p>

        <p>In general the instrumental sounds that can be created here fall
        under four
          basic categories.</p>
        <p>Kick from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_drum">A bass
        drum, or kick drum</a></p>

        <p>Snare from the <a

        <p>Clap, that&#39;s the sound that clapping your hands makes.</p>

    - type: text
      title: The Melody
      text: >-
        <p>It hurts my heart to say this lovely woman is doing something
        wrong.</p>

        <p>As a Professional Pianist, she is brilliant, but as a teacher, she is
        a
          Destroyer of Hopes.</p>
        <p>Don&#39;t listen to a word she says.</p>

        <p>Watch her hands.</p>

        <p>She is using both of them.</p>

        <p>Her left hand is creating low-frequency sounds, and she almost never
        does
          anything there, and she keeps things simple. She is almost doing drums with
          her left hand, she is laying down the beat.</p>
        <p>Ignore her left hand, now.</p>

        <p>Look at her right hand, at first she goes up and down. Then she does
        the
          pinky &amp; thumb, but still, even though she is playing notes apart, see it as
          one note, pay attention to thumb only. She does jump between keys, but it
          is rare and masked by her left hand that is doing the beat.</p>
        <p>The keys she presses at the same time with her right hand should be
        seen as
          one key, she is just mixing two sounds together to create a third sound.
          When she presses two keys at the same time, she is adding a third key.</p>
        <p>Why add keys to the piano. Because two keys at the same time sounds
        richer
          than pressing one key.</p>
        <p>Making a single sound out of pressing multiple keys at the same time,
        is
          called making a chord. Chords are multiple notes played at the same time,
          for the purpose of enriching the complexity of what you hear.</p>
        <p>Left hand does the simple beat, it must always be simple.</p>

        <p>Right hand does the melody, slowly goes up and down, in this
        particular
          video chords aside, she only skips one key to get to the next note.</p>
        <p>All of this is obscured, because she was taught Music Theory
        compatible
          with Mozart &amp; Chopin.</p>
        <p>You are being taught to break out. Chords are beautiful for sure,
        but, you
          just use the recording (the sound sample a .wav/mp3 of the chord) and focus
          on composition.</p>
        <p>Melodies are not made by learning how to play a piano. They are made
        in
          <a href="https://lmms.io/">LMMS</a> by gently moving up and down.</p>

        <p>You must never fear.</p>

        <p>There are many theories.</p>

        <p>Newton, went as far as saying that he made Calculus more complicated
        than
          it should be, on purpose.</p>
        <p>Chopin, would never dare to simplify his work.</p>

        <p>But that won&#39;t stop me.</p>

        <p>Anybody can trace a printout of something they like with tracing
        paper.
          What many don&#39;t understand is that after tracing, you need to black out the

        <p>Then you place your trace on proper Drawing Paper. Then, go over your

      text: >-
        <p>By blacking out the back of your trace you create Graphite Paper.</p>

        <p>You can skip this step by buying pre-made Graphite Paper. (Pre-made
          Graphite Paper is a <strong>lot</strong> darker and sharper. If you trace something that
          has a lot of small details, you should use Graphite Paper.)</p>
        <p>Now you will place Graphite Paper over your Drawing paper, and then
        put
          your trace on top, and then go over it with a pencil.</p>

        <p>Lightbox will help you with tracing and creation of new designs.</p>

        <p>A light box is an interesting addition to the process of tracing, it
        does
          need batteries, or a USB port. When buying an inexpensive light box ($25),
          you might want to consider getting a tiny battery powered <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Mini+Projector&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">projector</a>
          ($75) as well.</p>

        <p>You can take a selfie, connect your phone to the projector, and begin
          painting.</p>
        <p>Even better you can connect your Raspberry PI, or Laptop and use a
        program
          like <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> where you can manipulate your source material to reveal
          edges, colors, or adjust contrast while painting to reveal the brightest
          parts of your source material.</p>
        <p>Tip: Consider putting registration marks in your image and on your
        canvas,
          it is easier to resume your work after you bump the projector or call it a
          night.</p>
        <p>Idea: Record your painting progress and upload a sped up movie to
        YouTube.</p>

        <p>&quot;I&#39;m a professional graphic designer and illustrator with a
        soft spot for
          fur kids. I&#39;ve always loved painting and drawing animals. Our pets are like
          family, and I truly enjoy working on tributes to these silly, lovable,
          trusting and loyal creatures. In addition to Bri Pet Portraits, I am also
          on Etsy under the shop Bri Baby Art - a shop featuring custom artworks for
          nurseries and kids room decor.&quot; (from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/BriPetPortraits">BriPetPortraits on Etsy</a>)</p>
        <p>Custom Pet Portraits. Online business where people upload an image,
        and you
          create a large canvas painting, or drawing. It looks like the price is
          about $50 per portrait. Throw in a bonus, record a time lapse video of the
          painting for advertising, portfolio, and internet points.</p>

        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore
        64</a> (1982) still feature in the Demoscene today. The demoscene is an
        international computer art subculture focused on producing demos:
        self-contained, sometimes extremely small, computer programs that
        produce audio-visual presentations. The purpose of a demo is to show off
        programming, visual art, and musical skills. Demos and other demoscene
        productions are shared at festivals known as demoparties, voted on by
        those who attend, and released online. Take a look at <a

      text: >-
        <p>Below is a picture of why you must choose the Cut &amp; Sew method.
        The
          printing process on pre-made garments is flawed, the gas will not permeate
          wrinkles that are sure to occur on pre-made garments. You must first create
          the fabric, and then Cut &amp; Sew the garment. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQdPP04qEwU">source
            video</a> that demonstrates the problem with sublimating pre-made garments
          in a bit more detail.</p>

        <p>A shell prompt is the thing that indicates that you are free to type
          commands. Her dad’s shell prompt is broken, he messed up with whatever was
          supposed to go in between those square brackets, it maybe that he is using
          fonts that the Raspberry PI does not have, or some mess like that. My
          prompt as I write this is [user@computer warrior]$ that means username is
          user, my computer’s network name is computer, and the directory I am in is
          warrior.</p>
        <p>The dollar sign $ indicates that I, alex, and pi are normal users.
        You can
          escalate your system privileges to become a system administrator where you
          can read or delete other user’s files. On most systems the dollar sign
          would then change to the pound sign # to indicate that care must be taken

        <p>Now, when the Little Hacker Lady, logs into her dad’s computer she
        makes it
          talk using the <strong>say</strong> command.</p>
        <p>A command is a feature of the Operating System, using commands is a
          management or administrative task, it is not really true programming, but
          it is OK to call it that.</p>
        <p>The say command uses <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis">speech
        synthesis</a> to convert text to speech. The
          say command resides on her dad’s computer, and thus uses her dad’s speaker.
          She executes the command at <a href="https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=310">5:10</a></p>
        <p>The command she executes is wonderfully illustrative:</p>

        <p><strong>say -v serena dad watch out</strong></p>

        <p>You see that -v that’s a special directive that states when executing
        the
          say command use the voice of serena, serena is a cute name for a library of
          sounds, the say command supports multiple voices, serena is one of them.</p>
        <p>How do people know that -v means voice, and how do they know that
        serena
          is one of the voices? <strong>Nobody knows this at first</strong>, before a person
          executes a command they read about it in a manual. The manual command is
          called man and people usually type man followed by the command-name that
          they want to learn about. In this case: man say (meaning bring up the
          manual page for the say command). The man page will tell you how you can
          list all the available voices too (say -v=?), a command like say can do
          multiple things based on what you are trying to do. Here is the internet
          version of a man page for say: <a href="https://ss64.com/osx/say.html">https://ss64.com/osx/say.html</a></p>
        <p>People are not happy with this. Many try to create simplified man
        pages,
          here is one example <a href="https://tldr.sh/">https://tldr.sh/</a> but it is always best to go to
          the source, and just get used to the man command.</p>
        <p>She didn’t need to use the serena voice library, she could have just
          executed:</p>
        <p><strong>say dad watch out</strong></p>

        <p>And the say command would use the default voice. The say command is
        mostly
          available on Macs, Raspberry Pi will likely use the espeak command.</p>
        <p><strong>espeak &quot;dad watch out&quot;</strong></p>

        <p>Espeak command is slightly different, for it gets confused by
        multiple
          words, you have to join them together by wrapping them in quotes. A
          programmer should demand that his program code has good hygiene. eSpeak
          simply said “I am not just going to read everything that you type at me”
          whereas the programmer that made the say command said “Let’s just assume
          that whatever they throw at us needs to be converted to speech unless
          something starts with a hyphen”. The say command makes assumptions, whereas
          espeak is very strict about input.</p>

      text: >-
        <p>At <a href="https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=229">3:49</a> the Little
        Lady Hacker explains that she will be shutting down
          her dad’s code editor, and writes down the Process ID number 95251. Mac
          users frequently use <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> code editor. She issues the kill
          command with the -9 switch, this is a terrible idea, as it basically
          crashes her dad’s code editor and the -9 ensures there is no way to save
          data. Here is the man page for the kill command
          <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill">https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill</a>. Unix programs that are actively
          running are called processes (as in a program that is processing something)
          and each process has a number. The kill command can be used during
          development and debugging, in a reboot scenario, or when battery is about
          to die on a laptop, it has its proper uses. As a joke, it is already bad
          enough to use the kill command on a process as it sends a TERM[inate]
          signal. As a programmer you can add a signal handler in your program, and
          then in case of TERM signal you can for example ask the user to save his
          data, the TERM signal is an advisory. The -9 sends a KILL signal. There is
          no handler for the KILL signal, there is no saving work, the process is
          destroyed by the Operating System, whatever he was working on is lost. She
          executes kill -9 95251 at <a href="https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=326">5:26</a> his code editor disappears instantly.
          <strong>Yikes!</strong></p>

          <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">HOWTO</a> on hackers from which I quote below:</p>
        <p><strong>What Is a Hacker?</strong></p>

        <p>There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and
          networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the
          first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments. The
          members of this culture originated the term ‘hacker’. Hackers built the
          Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today. Hackers
          make the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this culture, if you have
          contributed to it and other people in it know who you are and call you a
          hacker, you’re a hacker.</p>
        <p>The hacker mind-set is not confined to this software-hacker culture.
        There
          are people who apply the hacker attitude to other things, like electronics
          or music — actually, you can find it at the highest levels of any science
          or art. Software hackers recognize these kindred spirits elsewhere and may
          call them ‘hackers’ too — and some claim that the hacker nature is really
          independent of the particular medium the hacker works in.</p>
        <p>There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers,
        but
          aren&#39;t. These are people (mainly adolescent males, and little girls) who
          get a kick out of breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system.
          Real hackers call these people ‘crackers’ and want nothing to do with them.
          Real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not very
          bright, and object that being able to break security doesn&#39;t make you a
          hacker any more than being able to hot-wire cars makes you an automotive
          engineer. Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled into
          using the word ‘hacker’ to describe crackers; this irritates real hackers
          no end.</p>
        <p>The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break
        them.”</p>

      text: >-
        <p>A command is a program made easy to execute. In other words by
        turning a
          program into a command, the programmer standardizes the execution and
          customization of the program.</p>
        <p>Usually programs need compilation, or an interpreter, they need some
          libraries. Often programs may need to be configured somehow, be it a
          configuration file, or just editing code. Programs may be hard to run,
          because every program is different.</p>
        <p>When a programmer decides to turn his program into a command,
        something
          wonderful happens. The programmer adds a bunch of stuff to his program to
          make it into a command, and thus <em>standardizes</em> the way the program is ran
          and customized.</p>

          with a graphic user interface (GUI), then you don&#39;t need to worry about

      title: File Download Command
      text: >-
        <p>Some commands are so good at what they do there is only a couple of
        them
          <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wget.1.html">wget</a> and <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/curl.1.html">curl</a> are a good example of that. cURL downloads files
          really well, it is also very frequently used for debugging or testing
          web-servers that serve files, it is a very efficient program. wget is
          awesome at resuming downloads and downloading large files, it actually has
          a feature that not only downloads a web page, but also all the images and
          other web pages that are linked to it.</p>
        <p>There are also some really eyebrow raising commands like <a
        href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md">youtube-dl</a>
          which comes with an --extract-audio argument, meaning, it will make an mp3
          out of a video.</p>
        <p>I don&#39;t know what Alphabet&#39;s Terms of Service state on the
        subject of
          downloading their data. I don&#39;t recommend you use this command, unless you
          familiarize yourself with their Terms of Service, specifics of downloading
          content with third-party tools, and own the content yourself. Note that it
          is not just a YouTube account that may get suspended, but all the rest too,
          gmail and google docs, stuff on your android phone, etc.</p>
        <p>Here is what the command would look for a YouTube Creator hoping to
        make a
          backup of a particular video.</p>
        <p>youtube-dl <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR%5C_VIDEO%5C_ID">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR\_VIDEO\_ID</a></p>

        <p>And here is the code for saving just the audio it self, this is
        useful for
          making an audio only version of an adventure video or remixing your content
          in a song.</p>
        <p>youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR%5C_VIDEO%5C_ID">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR\_VIDEO\_ID</a></p>
        <p>Look how simple and easy to read. Commands can save you from
        thousands of
          mouse clicks and hours of annoying, repetitive work. Commands are a
          beautiful invention. Graphic user interfaces are helpful when learning
          computers, but eventually they will force you into a world of clicks.</p>

      title: Simplicity Lost
      text: >-
        <p>Originally, the beauty of commands was in being predictable,
        readable, and
          not causing surprises. UNIX style operating systems, are well thought out.
          But, people will cram a lot more than they should, and it gets out of
          control, here is a mild example of mixing some video files with the ffmpeg
          command.</p>
        <p>ffmpeg -i test1.avi -i test2.avi -vcodec copy -acodec copy -vcodec
        copy
          -acodec copy test12.avi -newvideo -newaudio</p>
        <p>I have some guesses as to what the ff stands for. You can visit the
        manual
          page here: <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/ffmpeg">https://linux.die.net/man/1/ffmpeg</a></p>

      title: Pipes
      text: >-
        <p>There is a feature in the command world, that can deal with high
          complexity, and that is the pipe. Meaning two commands can be connected by
          a pipe in the following manner</p>
        <p>print &quot;hello world&quot; | uppercase</p>

        <p>This would result in changing all text to uppercase, and printing it
        on the
          screen.</p>
        <p>HELLO WORLD</p>
    - type: text
      title: Redirects
      text: >-
        <p>There is also a feature of pipes that creates files and that is the
        greater
          than symbol &quot;&gt;&quot;.</p>
        <p>print &quot;hello world&quot; | uppercase &gt; greetings.txt</p>

        <p>This would result in changing all text to uppercase too, but instead
        of
          seeing &quot;HELLO WORLD&quot; on the screen we’d see it in the file named
          greetings.txt</p>
    - type: text
      title: User Interface
      text: >-
        <p>While Pipes and Redirects of the Command Line are often enough. A
        number of
          Graphical Pipe Editors exists as well, Node-RED is a nice example.</p>

      title: Recap and Summary
      text: >-
        <p>In The Wizard chapter we learned not to confuse the operating system,
        with
          the user interface; as those are two separate kinds of computer programs.</p>
        <p>Now we learn that UNIX is an operating system with a user interface
          classified as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">Command-line interface</a>, let us take a closer look at
          the command-line interface.</p>
    - type: text
      title: Uniformity of Commands
      text: >-
        <p>Once you learn the shape that a command can take, you will be able to
        use
          any command on any system.</p>
        <p>Let us proceed with an imaginary command &quot;print&quot; that has
        some extra
          features.</p>
    - type: text
      title: Command Documentation
      text: >-
        <p>Most well behaved commands can be executed with the --help argument,
        or the
          -h flag to print some helpful documentation.</p>
        <p>print --help</p>

        <p>Popular commands will come with manual pages that can be read with
        the man
          command. In this case we would execute: man print</p>
    - type: text
      title: The Simplest Form
      text: >-
        <p>In the following example there is one argument &quot;hello
        world&quot;. Without
          quotes the command would see two arguments &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;world&quot;. Quotes are
          used to join two or more things together.</p>
        <p>print &quot;hello world&quot;</p>
    - type: text
      title: The Extended Form
      text: >-
        <p>In the next example we have a Boolean flag &quot;-u&quot; meaning
        enable underline
          mode. To disable the underline mode, you simply remove the -u. Then we have
          the extended argument &quot;--format&quot; followed by a directive &quot;capitalize&quot;.
          Supported directives can be found in documentation.</p>
        <p>print -u --format capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</p>

        <p>To make things easier to type, most commands allow short form of
        extended
          arguments, so --format can become -f.</p>
        <p>print -u -f capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</p>

        <p>Conversely, most one letter arguments/flags have an extended form
        that
          begins with two hyphens. Note how -u changed to --underline.</p>
        <p>print --underline -f capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</p>

        <p>For clarity and readability, I recommend using extended forms.</p>

        <p>print --underline --format capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</p>
    - type: text
      title: Why would anyone want to apply a Command-line interface to something?
      text: >-
        <p>Because of the uniformity of command syntax. Once you know how to run
        one
          command, you know how to run them all. You just need to pull up the
          documentation to see what all the commands are and what arguments they
          accept.</p>

        <p>Please read <a
        href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts">github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts</a>
        Which &quot;hack&quot; this poor
          bastard&#39;s coffemaker, soon to be ruined romantic life, a particularly needy
          customer, and alcoholism. Based on a true story, apparently.</p>
        <p>Please note how the community of geeks that love this story came
        together
          and started re-creating these &quot;hacker&quot; scripts in the programming languages
          they favor; probably out of sadness.</p>
        <p>Here is the Node.js Version of <a
        href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/nodejs/fucking_coffee.js">fucking_coffee.js</a>.
        Note that once the
          telnet connection is established at line number 22, we begin using the
          coffeemaker command-line interface: sys brew (line 26), sys pour (line 32).</p>
        <p>Don&#39;t think of the coffeemaker as running UNIX, just think of it
        as it
          being controlled by a command line interface somewhere.</p>
        <p>Any machine with a button or two is a system with enough complexity
        to
          benefit from a command-line interface.</p>
        <p>Note how you have never programmed a coffeemaker before, and yet you
        know
          precisely - and may even remember for months to come - the commands &quot;sys
          brew&quot; and &quot;sys pour&quot;.</p>
        <p>sys brew</p>

        <p>sys pour</p>

        <p>It seems sys is a single command that looks at the first text
        argument.
          Executing sys -h would probably print:</p>
        <p> Coffemaker Help ---- -h / --help print this text -v / --verbose
        print
          debugging information -b / --brew / or simply brew start brewing -p /
          --pour / or simply pour start pouring -r / --reboot / or simply reboot
          reboot the system ... </p>
        <p>Lack of proper etiquette, and using text (brew) instead of arguments
          (--brew/-b) can be an indication of sys being a script that does not take
          the time to parse anything it just looks at the first thing after the
          command name. It is actually difficult to parse arguments (-b/--brew), it
          takes no effort at all to use raw text (brew).</p>

          stick a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry PI</a> into a cheap one and make my own sys command
          (with proper argument parsing).</p>
        <p>If you are courageous enough to do this, might as well install a
        small web
          server, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_Room_coffee_pot">stream the coffeemaker</a> using the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/">camera board module</a>, and

      title: What to Avoid
      text: >-
        <p>Shopify is the world’s fastest growing commerce platform and we have
        no
          plans to slow down! The Shopify Theme Partnerships team is on a mission to
          make sure our merchants have access to the highest quality themes
          available. Every month, thousands of merchants look for new themes for
          their online stores. Our team is on the lookout for skilled, passionate
          designers and developers we can work with to create amazing themes for the
          Theme Store.</p>
        <h5 id="important-information-to-know-before-you-apply">Important
        information to know before you apply</h5>

        <p>Here are a few things to consider before you send us your Theme
        Partner
          application:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Shopify themes need constant care and attention. We expect Theme
            Partners who work with us to be engaged, passionate about their theme(s),
            and apply any theme updates we request in a timely manner.</li>
          <li>Being a Theme Partner is a full-time job. You will need to dedicate a
            lot of time updating your theme(s) as well as supporting the merchants who
            are using your theme. If you become a Theme Partner, you’ll need to
            consider how you’ll balance Theme Partner work with other jobs you are
            currently doing, or are planning to be engaged in.</li>
          <li>Our current Theme Partners are a tight-knit group of people. We expect
            potential Theme Partners to be approachable and collaborative with the
            Shopify Theme Partnerships team, as well as merchants using your theme(s).</li>
          <li>We want Theme Partners to actively contribute to the Shopify themes
            ecosystem, and work with us to help merchants succeed. The Theme
            Partnerships team will be working closely with you every step of the way
            during the theme submission process, and will continue to work closely with
            you once your theme is published. We have dedicated email and Slack
            channels set up to provide feedback, advice and support for all your
            theme-related questions and issues.</li>
          <li>The revenue share for Theme Partners is 70/30. The Theme Partner
            receives 70% of each theme sale.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 id="what-to-submit-when-you-apply">What to submit when you
        apply</h5>

        <p>Please email themes@shopify.com and include all of the following:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>A link to an active Shopify website you built for a client. This must
            be a live, fully functioning shop that you built for a client.</li>
          <li>A case study for the above Shopify website that details your
            experiences on the project. You will need to provide an overview of the
            project and the client.</li>
          <li>A cover letter.</li>
          <li>A link to your design portfolio.</li>
        </ol>

        <h5 id="how-we-review-your-application">How we review your
        application</h5>

        <p>For the <strong>active Shopify website</strong> our review will
        cover:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Problem solving ability (the solution outlined in the case study is
            visible).</li>
          <li>Originality (the shop is using a custom theme, not a free or paid theme
            from the Shopify Theme Store).</li>
          <li>Art direction (choice of photography, images, icons, color, and overall
            originality).</li>
          <li>Layout (flow of content, hierarchy, balance, contrast, white space,
            responsiveness, grid, and alignment).</li>
          <li>Typography (font pairings, font sizes, line spacing, hierarchy of text,
            number of fonts used, and legibility of text).</li>
          <li>Consistency in design patterns (between pages and on a single page).</li>
          <li>Accessibility (hover states, colour ratios, and touch targets).</li>
          <li>Customer UX (purchase flow through the collection, product, and cart
            pages).</li>
          <li>Technical ability (up-to-date with Shopify platform, website
            functionality, code consistency, and lack of errors).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For the <strong>case study</strong> we will be looking for you to
        provide this
          information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What brought the client to you?</li>
          <li>What were the client’s needs?</li>
          <li>How did you go about solving their problem?</li>
          <li>We would like to see your research, your workflow (prototyping and
            refining), and what you learned.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For the <strong>cover letter</strong> we would like to see the
        following information:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>An outline of who you (and your team) are.</li>
          <li>Why you want to join the Shopify Theme Partner community?</li>
          <li>Why you think you’d do well as a Theme Partner?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Feel free to put your own personal touch or spin on the cover letter.
        We
          highly value originality, enthusiasm, and motivation when considering
          applications.</p>
        <p>For the <strong>design portfolio</strong> we will be reviewing the
        same design related
          points as mentioned above for the active Shopify website:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Art direction.</li>
          <li>Layout.</li>
          <li>Typography.</li>
          <li>Consistency.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Shopify Theme Partnerships team is not able to provide detailed
          feedback on why an application does not pass our review process. If we do
          reach out to you about becoming a potential Theme Partner, we will work
          with you on the next steps of the approval process.</p>
        <h5 id="your-theme-in-the-shopify-theme-store">Your theme in the Shopify
        Theme Store</h5>

        <p>Once a theme has been built and approved, it may only be distributed
        via
          the Theme Store. Please do not distribute your theme on other marketplaces
          or third-party channels, or try to take customers away from the Theme Store.</p>
        <h5 id="theme-support">Theme support</h5>

        <p>If there is a technical issue with your theme (for example: broken
        layout,
          dead link, logic error) you will be responsible for fixing the issue in a
          timely fashion. Critical bugs must be fixed immediately or your theme may
          be temporarily removed from the Theme Store.</p>
        <p>Theme Partners are responsible for supporting merchants who use their
          theme(s). You will need to provide a public support email address, theme
          documentation, and assist merchants with their theme-related questions.</p>
        <p>Themes will be removed from the Theme Store if they have made less
        than 25
          sales in a 3 month time period. Theme Partners are responsible for keeping
          their themes up-to-date with core Shopify features and any improved
          standards Shopify implements in the future. These can include improvements
          to the overall user experience, the user interface, accessibility, and more.</p>

      title: The Challenge
      text: >-
        <p>Now, a job making themes for Shopify is great for a Web Design
        start-up
          struggling to get customers, as 160 sales would get them $20K, after the
          30% cut (of $8,640). But for an outsider looking in, it is just a look into
          the world of professional web development, and never-ending bug fixing.
          Aside from regular bugs, both code-bases (bootstrap and shopify) are under
          active development, that is a lot of code updates.</p>
        <p>There is a smaller but streamlined theme sales platform, with <a
        href="https://support.wrapbootstrap.com/help/submission-guidelines-themes-and-templates">more
            reasonable restrictions</a>. Take a look at the sales stats that they
          parade right at their <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/">front page</a>. At 48,623 sales priced at $44 USD,
          the <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/inspinia-responsive-admin-theme-WB0R5L90S">INSPINIA - Responsive Admin Theme</a> would have made 2.2 million USD.
          Even if WrapBootstrap took 50% of that, the developer took a million home.</p>
        <p>Now remember <a
        href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/inspinia-responsive-admin-theme-WB0R5L90S">INSPINIA</a>
        is sitting right on top of <a
        href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> so
          <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pulse">all this development is going on in the back</a> at no charge to <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/user/WebAppLayers">INSPINIA
            Developers</a>. All they do is add more components, and keep up with the
          latest updates to the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> code base.</p>

        <p>The Web Developer, that you need to become creates the streamlined,
          low-liability versions of <a href="wrapbootstrap.com">wrapbootstrap.com</a>, <a href="https://themes.shopify.com/">themes.shopify.com</a>,
          or even <a href="https://shopify.com/">shopify.com</a> it self, and others that tickle your fancy in
          similar ways.</p>
        <p>Now when I went to the website of INSPINIA developers, I got
        redirected to
          wrapbootstrap.com. This may mean - and in deed it would make perfect sense</p>
        <ul>
          <li>that WrapBootstrap made INSPINIA. This would also mean that they made 2.2
            Million Dollars, they pocketed 100% of those sales ([3rd party sellers earn
            80%]<a href="https://support.wrapbootstrap.com/help/fee-structure">4</a>).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your story may be even more elaborate than this. You maybe taking a
        step
          above the platforms, and sell a service where a person can rent a platform
          like <a href="wrapbootstrap.com">wrapbootstrap.com</a> or <a href="https://themes.shopify.com/">themes.shopify.com</a> for a monthly
          membership fee and a reasonable percentage of sales.</p>

      title: Become a CEO
      text: >-
        <p>Web Developer, is a huge step. But making themes is not it. It is not
        even
          about learning programming, though you should definitely know about it;
          because you need a team of programmers to develop your sales platform(s).</p>
        <p>It is about becoming a Businessperson with a plan. In other words, a
          Founder, a CEO.</p>
        <p>You shouldn&#39;t think of a web developer as a person that merely
        develops for
          the web, think of one as a developer of the web. That is a difference
          between $180 and $2,200,000, a resume and an outstanding portfolio, an
          employee and an employer, bugfixes and excitement.</p>

        <p>We knew there was no conspiracy, no deliberate ill intent, no plan to
          betray a student for a paycheck.</p>
        <p>Many of the teachers were our friends, family, people we admired.
        Many felt
          bad about the level of education we were receiving.</p>
        <p>But, whether they liked it or not, consciously or subconsciously, at
        the
          end of the day, it was clear that the teachers were forcing us to memorize
          for long enough to pass standardized testing, and the administration didn&#39;t

        <p>In K-12 they taught us that delicate hearts belonged with mommy at
        home,
          that bullies were a fact, and life is never fair. They hurt our hearts, and

          were working hard, and then some things needed to be taken away, and a few
          needed to be twisted around.</p>
        <p>We were forced to recognize that teachers work really, really hard,
        that
          the administration works very hard, it is all hard work, extremely
          stressful. People give up days off, cancel vacations, make sacrifices.</p>
        <p>To question administration or teachers while they work that hard,
        makes for
          a heartless, cruel, shameful petty little student.</p>

      text: >-
        <p>Teaching should respectfully extend their existing knowledge. The
        teacher
          must know if fascination with Dinosaurs will head towards Paleontology,
          Biology, Ecology, and keep an eye on progression of that path (if said path
          continues) to see is they have a Cell Bilogist, Astrobiologist,
          Evolutionary Biologist, or maybe a Writer, in their class.</p>
        <p>The complexity of teaching may actually scale with the reward, how
          fantastic it must be to help our Dino Girl to ponder inter-planetary
          cross-contamination from the Chicxulub crater and witness her journey lean
          towards Astrobiology and an internship at NASA/ESA, possibly a career.</p>
        <p>Now, pushing her away from what moves her, grading her down for it,
        and
          forcing her to memorize whatever is in the curriculum so that she may pass
          the grade. That is something else... And the answer to how many children
          were hurt this way, is: <strong>all of them</strong>, in every school, on every
          continent, in every country, state and district.</p>
        <p>Schools interrupt education.</p>

        <p>They destroy careers, passions, inspirations, talents, and genius.
        They do
          it just a split second before the Kids know how to protect it.</p>
        <p>They destroy The Shy, The Delicate, The Compassionate.</p>

        <p>Nobody, really, took grades seriously because of how easy it was to
        cram
          before a test, pass it, and forget it. Since tests did not represent

        <p>Dan Cardinali&#39;s definition of Non Cognitive Skills includes the
        following:
          Building grit, and resilience, and persistence, and self-regulation. He&#39;s
          describing skills of a Warrior, a Fighter, an Authentic Grown Up.</p>
        <p>Dan Cardinali explains that ideally families should provide Non
        Cognitive
          Skills (Child Development), and then schools will deliver Academic
          Development (Math, History, Physics).</p>
        <p>But this is not how it works today, well to do parents are too busy,
          parents stricken by poverty can&#39;t have time, and non-cognitive skill
          development is not only unavailable, but is often laughed at by teachers
          &quot;Parents do your job.&quot; they brainlessly utter.</p>
        <p>Above all, a child born to the culture of poverty (lacking
        non-cognitive
          skills) will often remain in the culture of poverty be it dropping out or
          graduation. The steps out and up are just too far apart.</p>

      text: >-
        <p>It is correct to say that Poverty of Mind is rooted in lack of Non
          Cognitive Skills.</p>
        <p>An example of poverty of mind is inability to have an expensive lunch
        with
          an internship company CEO. Out of fear of not knowing <strong>EVERYTHING!</strong> from
          how to get a table to when to order, or even if it is OK to just have the
          cute little bagel and focus on the questionnaire. Lunch, if not impossible,
          can be impossibly terrifying.</p>
        <p>There is no breaking out of poverty when every-step induces fear,
          confusion, anxiety.</p>
        <p>To be clear, the ultimate aim for both Student and Principal. Almost
          always, is to rise and break away, become a CEO.</p>
        <p>Become an inspiration and a teacher; to make life more. To then
        retire come
          the Golden Age of Wisdom and write. Write about the lessons that counted to
          make them last even longer. Create an Audio Book in your own voice in hopes
          of it being used 50 years from now to Rise &amp; Learn to Really Learn. What an
          Honor to have your spirit revived by means of Admiration and Love, your own
          voice across decades, maybe centuries, maybe forever.</p>
        <p>Instead, the children are getting scared, mostly because they can see
          schools are forcing irrelevant learning that fades away. It is impossible
          to retain irrelevant knowledge. In context of education, forcing irrelevant
          knowledge and grading a student down for lack of retention is evil.</p>
        <p>And here the child does not want the job because it has too many
          complications, can&#39;t even have the internship lunch because it is too
          terrifying, and can&#39;t conceive of the notion of connecting with the CEO in
          such a way as to eventually resign position and start a company in a
          similar sector.</p>
        <p>They are scared, sometimes crushed, but far too brave to show you...

        <p>It must protect against all kinds of poverty, and bad parents,

        <p>Focus on Real Education, not Administration. If you need money, then
        look
          to your students.</p>
        <p>Become a Start-up Accelerator. Give them initial mentoring and
        funding,
          Take a small percentage of their earnings in return for the initial funding
          and in order to fund other start-ups. Take only for a small number of
          years, and only what you need. Get out of their way.</p>
        <p>Never forget, Principal. You serve The Kids, The Students, they are
        the
          point of it all, they are the future. The Children are not your means to
          staying in business and getting paid- that would make you a Monster and a
          Fraud.</p>
        <p>The best way to fight poverty in a person&#39;s mind, is to set a
        student up
          for a job so high up, that it will make them want to run out of the school
          quietly-yelling and hope they never need to come back.</p>
        <p>A prestigious position at a local Hospital as a Research Nurse that
        keeps
          everyone informed a month ahead of time, a complicated job at the Library
          of Congress, or as Someone Amazing at the Detroit Institute of Arts.</p>
        <p>Set a step so high, that it is already a healthy career but
        completely
          unreachable to the child, the step up being, Just Impossible. And then
          slowly, build. But smaller steps, and maybe even smaller, or maybe even an
          on-ramp for a smooth ride.</p>

        <p>We must face the misjudgment of the role of poverty in education.</p>

        <p>We must face the misjudgment of the the gravity of poverty.</p>

        <p>We must face policy that does not make sense, that will never make
        sense,
          due to persistent malformed-understanding of education.</p>
        <p>Education begins in kindergarten, it is easy to forget this.</p>

        <p>It begins with mentors, inspiration, friendship.</p>

        <p>There is no education without human connection, but there is merit in
        apps,
          computer programs, videos, audio books, and overhead internet satellites.</p>
        <p>We need a clear aim, for both, educators, and the kids. There is no

        <p>It is easy to misunderstand the purpose of Education.</p>

        <p>We don&#39;t need a generation of Brilliant and Unstoppable Teachers,

        <p>Pretending to be wise and authentic is far too easy, to put the

        <p>Even if it wasn&#39;t a fantasy aimed to place responsibility for
        education
          elsewhere, there is no good reason to wait for Policy Makers to update
          policy.</p>
        <p>We must teach children that they are responsible for their own

        <p>We don&#39;t need better teachers, we need and endless supply of

        <p>&quot;Education is not the filling of a vessel, but the kindling of a
        flame.&quot;</p>

        <p>The cradle of education is within. The flame of curiosity, lives
        within.
          Students reach out and put things into their soul, all the time.</p>
        <p>Sometimes all it takes is a poem.</p>

        <p>Sometimes the explanation, that all education is really for, is
        beating
          back Poverty of Mind-and-Wallet.</p>
        <p>Poverty that they were unfortunately and unfairly dropped into, and
        now
          they must learn wisdom and fight their way out of, and if they so choose,
          bring back the light so that others may follow.</p>
        <p>And later, finally, enjoy their existence and high achievement, leave
        a
          legacy worthy of following.</p>
        <p>Never tell a child that life is not fair. That will only force them
        into
          accepting their poverty as a given, and your mediocrity as a fact.</p>
        <p>Education is never! for good grades, or a good resume, or a good job
        that
          pays well.</p>
        <p>Education is for the opposite of Memorization and Servitude.</p>

        <p>Education is for Creativity, and Freedom.</p>

        <p>Education is for Originality, and Independence.</p>

        <p>Education is for Unbrekability, and Leadership.</p>

        <p>The children you taught to wait for Superman, are, that promise, and
        the
          future, and more.</p>
        <p>And the opposite of high achievement is not failing while daring
        greatly.
          Failure is nonsense, just another excuse not to try. There is no such thing
          as failure. Every step forward adds to success.</p>

      title: Good Frameworks come with Easy On-boarding
      text: >-
        <p>Easy On-boarding means easy access to eventual mastery. It means
          progressive, gradual learning and mastery.</p>
        <p>It would be difficult, though not impossible, to learn to write words
          without knowing the alphabet. English, or as I call it here &quot;The English
          Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication&quot; bonds really well with
          our ability to learn words as a baby. The language evolved with human
          learning abilities. If English words were presented without letters, it
          would still be a functional, but very different language.</p>
        <p>Fundamentally, a framework without easy on-boarding, or progressive
          adaptation features is kind of useless. If there is no way to learn
          something, it won&#39;t be learned.</p>
        <p>But overall, new on-boarding can be tacked on to something that
        previously
          had trouble with it. For example in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Created_the_Integers">God Created the Integers: The
            Mathematical Breakthroughs That Changed History</a> Stephen Hawking helped
          his memory by creating a history of evolution of mathematical thinking. I
          view the book as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">Memory Palace</a> with emphasis on historical dates and
          progression, that expands standard mathematical on-boarding and helps the
          reader to a greater initial spectrum of Mathematics.</p>

      title: Memorizing πr²
      text: >-
        <p>Do you remember memorizing πr²?</p>

        <p>Forcing memorization of πr² or any formula, should be seen as
        psychological
          torture, means of intimidation. It should be seen as cause for suspension
          of the teacher, and review and repair of the damage they made.</p>
        <p>Formula memorization is the same as being forced to learn English
        without
          the use of alphabet. It is incredibly cruel.</p>
        <p>Some young lady out there, tears in eyes can&#39;t comprehend πr²,
        and her mind
          rejects memorization, she NEEDS to know - tears in eyes - why is the r is
          squared? Her mind reaching for why is the r multiplied by it self. Is there
          a geometric square somehow?</p>
        <p>Warm, but not warm enough.</p>

        <p>A brilliant mind yearning for arriving at the formula herself, yet
        forced
          to merely blindly accepting it, or repeating the whole year.</p>
        <p>People who need to invent the formulas, people who have the natural
          predisposition for abstract theoretical mathematics... The naturally
          predisposed for abstract mechanics or Mathematics, are being forced, not
          to, learn Mathematics, or be punished.</p>

        <p>Math is almost too easy to bother with, it is certainly too messy
        when
          compared to the exquisite and wonderfully unambiguous and vast world of
          programming.</p>
        <p>Basic programming is enough to visualize all the important things in
          mathematics.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">Math as Code</a></p>

        <p>It was only ever intimidating because it is a primitive language
        meant for
          paper and pencil, with an ugly problem to boot. As <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">Math as Code</a> notes
          &quot;Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author,
          context and the field of study (linear algebra, set theory, etc).&quot;</p>
        <p>It can be a wonderful and enlightening adventure to visit works of
        Newton
          from the simple world of programming, but to teach Calculus on paper is to
          waste your time on trivialities of a simple loop.</p>
        <p>Let us face that today&#39;s &quot;Alphabet of Math&quot; is basic
        Programming. This is
          because programming notation is not as ambiguous, and it is easier to
          latch-on-to-and-pursue mathematical concepts, as trivial as they will turn
          out to be to you now.</p>
        <p>As an enormous bonus, at the end of the day you can see your new
        knowledge
          come to life with a simple, mathematically themed program like <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/">P5js</a> or
          maybe <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a>, or even <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">SVG</a> (keep it in sync with leading Web
          Technologies as they receive most attention and thus good programming,
          exposure, use, and as a bonus bring a solid measure of fair employment
          opportunities).</p>
        <p>Some are moved by Ides, others by Numbers. As numbers can now come to
        life
          when transitioning from dead paper to colorful screens, games,
          visualizations.</p>

        <p>It is not just Drag and Drop programming, with works like <a
        href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">Math as Code</a>
          children who enjoy it, get access to Theoretical Physics and Abstract
          Mathematics. A child using the program that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language">Karlie teaches with</a> will
          see little surface difference between making a rectangle and converting
          matter to energy via Einstein&#39;s E=mc². A venture into the function
          contents, which are not too complex as shown in the previous video, may
          perhaps create a new Einstein, change the World, or Time, or better yet,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light">both</a>.</p>
        <p>In this short clip she interjects the use of variables and dynamic
          calculation; as a result she creates a reusable function that creates
          rectangles with a base twice the height.</p>
        <p>For many this is a mind blowing lesson that will call to them, pull
        them
          into the world of Math, Computers, Science, Technology.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.kodewithklossy.com/">Kode With Klossy</a> shows

          force-remembered.</p>
        <p>It is not possible to retain long-term what you memorized in the way

          did it. If that is what they expect of you, then you maybe being taken

        <p>GPA or not, you still need those Marvelous Frameworks; or people will

        <p>Your life depends on it. The future of this planet depends on You,
        don&#39;t

        <p>Your life depends on real education, your knowledge has impact on

        <p>The teacher will soon retire, feel great about all the great work,
        and you
          will become the future.</p>
        <p>Just, take it upon yourselves to learn on your own, it is safer this

          broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to

        <p>What Sun Tzu hoped we understood was this: &quot;Victorious warriors,
        master the
          sword before the battle; while defeated warriors hope to learn how to use
          the sword during their first sword-fight.&quot;</p>
        <p>Creating a tiny company with a winning product, even without filling
        out
          any paperwork. Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an
          Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between
          advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales.</p>
        <p>What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become
          energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it.</p>

        <p>Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when

        <p>A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way

        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV4DCdyLNgU">Google Ads</a>
        is a Good Idea. Every business person on the internet needs to advertise
        to get customers to come over. Google has a unique position where many
        people come to visit its pages, thus they can display ads; they have an
        advertising network. They have something everybody needs the moment they
        are ready for their first sale.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> or similar, is
        another great idea. It is a website that can generate a start-up
        website, based on some screenshots and text. Every start-up has
        screenshots, and no time to work on the website.</p>

        <p><a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/">Wrap Bootstrap</a>: User
        Interfaces are hard. Having your team create a powerful computer program
        is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme
        websites make sales. They have all the code, with all the colors and
        fonts matching, and it saves so much work to focus on the program and
        have the UI snippets ready.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89xIe8FbR2g">Parse</a>,
        because saving data, is huge. When developing applications you need User
        Accounts, but also some place to store information. Parse has been Open

        <p>Sitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good
        for
          research, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines.</p>
        <p>You must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the
