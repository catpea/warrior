      "text": "A Warrior is She that thrives and triumphs where’er She be: Listen A Warrior is She that thrives and triumphs where’er She be. You cannot be broken, you must use your misfortune to light your way. You can learn anything you want, there are no smarter. They are just actors, with a handful of fragile lessons, crafted to impress. There is nothing that can break you, there are no stronger. Look to the source of the pain, it comes from Innocence. Nothing rooted in Innocence is ugly, all lessons that come from being tricked, add up to make you more beautiful, enable your insight and foresight, and fuel your authenticity. When the regrets come at night, that's just you brain asking you, to think harder, to comprehend your beauty in full, No one can trick you, not for long enough. So, don't be scared. Memoirs, Audio-books, Lectures will show you how many better people there are. We all have to Enlarge our Worlds daily. Audiobooks, and Lectures, will show you that all you have met thus far were just the same type of person. Do not be afraid to rise. The people, or person you have long though about, exist. But before they can see you, you have to rise, and shine, and be seen. Don't be scared. Those who will use your Love, Innocence, Endurance and Generosity against you, have long been lost, they are blinded, and fractured, and damaged, and broken. They hold no power over you. If their attacks continue they will grind themselves to dust, and all the experiences that will be left in their wake, will make you stronger and better. Battles make you stronger, smarter, more beautiful. You are a Warrior, that's the oldest name for it. A Warrior is She that uses the harm that came her way as energy, who understands none can stay a child and all must grow, and enlarge their worlds. A Warrior can never be damaged, or hurt -- a Warrior Learns. A Warrior resists tears in the rain, just like she can resist weakness. We live in a fragile world, full of fragile people, with fragile egos, they speak fragile advice, with fragile words; from their fragile hills. A Warrior does not wait to be taught. A Warrior learns fastest on her own. Learn in the sequence that fits you best, learn at the pace that helps you most. Push the dark imaginings back, and rise. Move your hand. And push up. And stand up. Get ready to walk, and then run, day, after day, slightly longer. And then lift your weights, the way you learned to run, and then lift for longer, and never rest. And then, with your sweetest audio-book. Step. Step Up. Rise Up. To No End. This is The Life Of A Warrior. Nothing Can Crush You, Nothing Can Hold You. Don't You See? Everything Makes You Stronger, Everything Makes You Fight Longer. You, Are A Warrior., "

      "text": "Zeno of Citium: Zeno was the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy, which he taught in Athens from about 300 BC. Based on the moral ideas of the Cynics, Stoicism laid great emphasis on goodness and peace of mind gained from living a life of Virtue in accordance with Nature. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not allowing oneself to be controlled by whim, the desire for pleasure, or fear of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to do one’s part in nature’s plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and justly. Stoicism would have influenced the Roman Soldier., Marcus Aurelius: Emperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180 AD) shows his clemency towards the vanquished after his success against Germanic tribes. Marcus Aurelius wrote a book titled Meditations and today it is available as an Audiobook., Tomoe Gozen: Tomoe (c. 1157 - 1247) was especially beautiful, with white skin, long hair, and charming features. She was also a remarkably strong archer, and as a swordswoman she was a warrior worth a thousand, ready to confront a demon or a god, mounted or on foot. She handled unbroken horses with superb skill; she rode unscathed down perilous descents. Whenever a battle was imminent, Yoshinaka sent her out as his first captain, equipped with strong armor, an oversized sword, and a mighty bow; and she performed more deeds of valor than any of his other warriors., Great Strength: Where a Hunter had to be a hunter or perish, becoming a soldier was almost optional. A soldier needed training, skill and wisdom to survive into retirement. A soldier, also needed a tribe as not to live in isolation. It is in the wisdom of warriors returning from hell of war, that we find hard earned inspiration and strength; because there isn't a soldier that does not ask \"Why am I in hell?\". One of the most important lessons to take away from this, is that a soldier is saved inside out, not outside in., What Being a Warrior Really Means, Nitobe Inazō: A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise; nothing ruffles the equanimity of his spirit. In the heat of battle he remains cool; in the midst of catastrophes he keeps level his mind. Earthquakes do not shake him, he laughs at storms. We admire him as truly great, who, in the menacing presence of danger or death, retains his self-possession; who, for instance, can compose a poem under impending peril or hum a strain in the face of death. Such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing or in the voice, is taken as an infallible index of a large nature - of what we call a capacious mind, which, far from being pressed or crowded, has always room for something more., Eight virtues of Bushido by undefined: Righteousness Be acutely honest throughout your dealings with all people. Believe in justice, not from other people, but from yourself. To the true warrior, all points of view are deeply considered regarding honesty, justice and integrity. Warriors make a full commitment to their decisions. Heroic Courage Hiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all. A true warrior must have heroic courage. It is absolutely risky. It is living life completely, fully and wonderfully. Heroic courage is not blind. It is intelligent and strong. Benevolence, Compassion Through intense training and hard work the true warrior becomes quick and strong. They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be used for good. They have compassion. They help their fellow men at every opportunity. If an opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to find one. Respect True warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do not need to prove their strength. Warriors are not only respected for their strength in battle, but also by their dealings with others. The true strength of a warrior becomes apparent during difficult times. Integrity When warriors say that they will perform an action, it is as good as done. Nothing will stop them from completing what they say they will do. They do not have to ‘give their word’. They do not have to ‘promise’. Speaking and doing are the same action. Honour Warriors have only one judge of honor and character, and this is themselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are carried out are a reflection of whom they truly are. You cannot hide from yourself. Duty and Loyalty Warriors are responsible for everything that they have done and everything that they have said, and all of the consequences that follow. They are immensely loyal to all of those in their care. To everyone that they are responsible for, they remain fiercely true. Self-Control Warriors feel more than others. This calmness of behavior and composure of mind is rooted in the choice of endurance without a groan, wisdom over ignorance, understanding over confrontation, love over anger, and unbreakability in the face of suffering and loneliness., Prevention: I understand restoring law and peace requires armed conflict when there is nothing else that can be done to help families feel safe. I don't understand why bloody battles are necessary, why they cannot be prevented years before it is too late. The greater battle is in crafting the strategy of deescalation, years, decades ahead. The Greatest of Heroes, conspire to prevent conflict, and foster growth; by means of the Great Art of Fine Disregard for Rule., Stanislav Petrov, who averted possible nuclear war, Stanislav Petrov Movie, The Man Who Saved The World, Prevention, not War: To help a family, you build a library, a school, a free university, you open borders, and give them aid. You don't wait until it is too late, and call in the soldiers. War is Evil, War is Hell. I think we can learn a great deal from Bryan Stevenson's words Our humanity depends on everyone's humanity. We are one family, one people, there is no \"them\". It is just you, and me. All cultures must leave bad ideas behind, and converge on wisdom. Prevention., Mad World Mountain Dew, Hope: I think there was a hope that hard earned ideas won in hell of war would spread to no end in time. That, Knightly Virtues, Chivalry, Bushido, Stoicism, would grab a hold of Humanity and never let go, would never stop making us better and wiser. But even a meme has limitations, the gaps in schooling will end propagation of the most viral lessons, and poverty will return., Poverty: Poverty, Never Changes. Police in Chicago are calling for tougher sentencing, the gangs are saying \"I have kids, I need to put food on the table\". And one of the lessons we learn from this text is that \"A human being is more than the worst thing they have ever done.\" There is a class of soldier that is a product of their environment. Some are an emergent property of poverty. Maximization of survival, leads to the emergence of a self taught soldier., My path out of poverty by Lashon Amado, Hope: My friends, my heroes. The situation is only hopeless when we stand on the very bottom. When we rise, when we rise onto the shoulders of giants, things change. The Hopelessness of Poverty becomes transformed into a Hope. It becomes yet another mission, a new challenge. It becomes a source of wisdom, a source of Great Power., Homie Industries, Kennedy Peace Speech, Prevention: Humanity. Dignity. Knowledge. Wisdom. Foresight. Convergence. Peace., We Need You: The Timeless & Unbreakable Family of Great Beings needs you. Hopes for you. And the future generations, will need your shoulders to stand on. Rise to the challenge, become part of the thousands of years of hope, hope for Peace, World Peace. Confident, and Unafraid., "

Internal influences are as just as powerful at changing a human, as the external ones. To internalize Knightly Virtues, to live by them, to triumph by them, became a sure way to become a hero. Forbearance, Hardihood, Largesse, Benevolence, and Honour., Sir Galahad by Alfred Lord Tennyson: My good blade carves the casques of men, My tough lance thrusteth sure, My strength is as the strength of ten, Because my heart is pure., Men of Pure Heart: Superheroes like Galahad carried a message that put servitude second. For one cannot uphold the Knightly Virtues whilst blindly following orders issued by someone who does not strive to uphold them., Knight's Oath by undefined: The right can never die, If one man still recalls, The words are not forgot, If one voice speaks them clear, The code forever shines, If one heart holds it bright. The knight is sworn to valor, His heart knows only virtue, His blade defends the helpless, His might upholds the weak, His words speak only truth, His wrath undoes the wicked., Authenticity: A code of conduct that aimed to revolve around Authenticity, was born., Walter Scott: Chivalry! - why, maiden, she is the nurse of pure and high affection, - the stay of the oppressed, the redresser of grievances, the curb of the power of the tyrant - Nobility were but an empty name without her, and liberty finds the best protection in her lance and her sword., Pursuits of Excellence: What we know of the superheroes of middle ages comes from poems and recreations of the lost arts., King Arthur's Origins, Swordplay and the Lost Art of Knighthood, Above the Common Levels: By subtle analogy to high pursuits in modern era, we can estimate that to aim for greatness, to climb the highest of mountains built Hardihood, enabled Largesse, taught Benevolence, and helped with Honour. The stories of Virtuous Knights are journeys of pursuit of knowledge, and self discovery, of trials and tribulations, of overcoming and rising, of triumph and disaster. To search for the Grail, or Arthur, Percival, or Galahad, and the others; was to find the Knightly Virtues and Wisdom set to timeless songs and poems., "

May our philosophy be filled with power and may we connect in authenticity. May we strengthen and increase our admiration for honest dealing and clear thinking, and may our hatered of hypocrisy and pretence never diminish. May we inspire each other in our endeavor to live above the common levels of life. May we strengthen each other to choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong, and never to be content with a half truth even if the whole can’t be won. May we endow each other with courage that is born of loyalty to all that is noble and worthy, that scorns to compromise with vice and injustice and knows no fear when truth and right are in jeopardy. May we guard each other against flippancy and irreverence in the sacred things of life. May we grant each other new ties of friendship and new opportunities for leadership or service. May we kindle our hearts in fellowship with those of a cheerful countenance, and soften our hearts with sympathy for those who sorrow and suffer. May we help each other to maintain Honor untarnished and unsullied and to show forth in our lives the ideals we learned in doing our duty. All of which we ask in the names of those before us, of those who stand today, and those who are yet to rise., Modern Day: Here, we come to today, the modern times.

Examine your values and understand that you must choose one side or the other. Any compromise between good and evil only hurts the good and helps the evil. If you've understood what I've said, stop supporting your destroyers. Don't accept their philosophy. Your destroyers hold you by means of your endurance, your generosity, your innocence, and your love. Don't exhaust yourself to help build the kind of world that you see around you now. In the name of the best within you, don't sacrifice the world to those who will take away your happiness for it., Ayn Rand: One particularly magnificent being to go back and learn, and rise, and triumph is Ayn Rand., Ayn Rand First Interview 1959 (Full), Desiderata by Max Ehrmann: Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy., Education and Creativity: Learning is Unavoidable. Here is Sir Ken Robinson warning you that things are not as they should be., Do schools kill creativity?, He is not asking, he is teaching.: Sir Ken Robinson is clearly well educated and experienced. In preparation for this talk he would have wanted to come up with a powerful message, an idea worth sharing.

They have a habit of realistically appraising situations, and typically managing to focus on the things that they can change, and somehow accept the things that they can't.\" \"Make an intentional deliberate ongoing effort to tune in to what's good in your world.\" \"Number Three: Resilient people ask themselves \"Is what I'm doing helping or harming me?\" this is a question that's used a lot in good therapy.\" \"Is what I'm doing helping or harming me?\", Quo Vadis?: Please note that monitoring where each of your steps is taking you, whether it is good or bad for you, will help you navigate life and improve your decision making. Quo Vadis? My friends., Dan Millman's Ted Talk, A Warrior in Training: Dan Millman, wrote a book in which he featured him self as a character, next to the imaginary wise man Socrates, Soc for short.

Without growing up we will become weak or ill, and face those circles again., Another Mad World, Take Out The Trash: Dan Millman, teaches us to take out the trash, to erase doubt, negativity, fear, keep moving forward and become Vulnerable and Fearless Warriors., Peaceful Warrior Quotes, Soc: A warrior is not about perfection. Or invulnerability. He is about absolute vulnerability. That’s the only true courage., Vulnerability and Shame: The mighty Brené Brown further elucidates on the subject of vulnerability through what in my opinion is a two part TED talk: The power of vulnerability, and part two Listening to Shame., The power of vulnerability, Listening to shame, The Man in the Arena by Theodore Roosevelt: It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat., Suit Up: Put on the Superhero Suit and step into the arena, right now. Being ashamed to dance, or waiting until you are perfect to face your next challenge, are just illusions that are holding you back. You are each to become a Great Being. The world needs Superheroes., Become a Great Being: Be it fixing schools, or erasing borders, or just preventing Anthropocene from becoming an extinction event it will take a Great Being to be heard, Greta Thunberg is a wonderful example, today., Greta Thunberg, They are Everywhere and Everywhen: Erica Goldson carries on her message and self-education, aiming to inspire and help the world grow.

I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms..., Becky: Girl Outdoors Channel, Why I left school at 16..., 8 Day Solo, Canvas Lavvu, Woodburner, Bushcraft Camp, 8 Day Solo, Lavvu, Woods Camp - Part 2, Beef Stew, Hiking Scotland | Solo Backpacking | EP 1, Scotland Backpacking | Solo Hike | EP 2, Scotland Backpacking Solo | EP 3 - Mountain Hut | Backpacking Food, Hiking Scotland - Part 4 | Road Trip | Isle of Skye |, Survival Lilly: \"Hi, my name is Lilly!

A flat mattress will attempt to straighten the natural\n        curve to your lower back, in combination with lifting weights for prolonged\n        periods, this is a recipe for disaster.

      "text": "Bodybuilding: Bodybuilding is a side-effect of something more. Like Confidence, or Happiness, or Success, it will ensue from pursuit of things that seem just out of your reach., The Big Three: The workout consists of three complementary exercises arranged in a way that I don’t have to stop. Dumbbell Lateral Raise Standing Dumbbell Curls Overhead Shoulder Press Combined with dancing, which in this context is a form of stretching that doubles as a cardio workout. Good examples of fine workout songs are Blade’s Blood Rave for fast cardio and Blanco Brown’s The Git Up for rest and some stretching. I find it really helpful to add sugar to my workout water, but I am sure candy works just as well. Sweetened water (sometimes V8 tomato juice) and good music are the two things that I find most helpful during my routine. In weight lifting there maybe difficult discomfort 5 – 10 lifts into some routine, then you switch to some other exercise (for example from Standing Dumbbell Curls to Overhead Shoulder Press where your biceps rest while you perform the shoulder press), you never sit, you never lie, you use both arms, both legs, you don’t stop to rest. If you need to stop then your weights are too heavy, and your workout is not working out. Start in the beginning, come to the end, and then stop. Start with 3.5lb per hand, even if out of humility, even if just to remind yourself that you always start in the beginning, and you always finish what you start., Dress for Confidence and Joy, Hit Every Beat: There is no struggle because of music, the parts of your brain that are telling you to stop are weak. They are weaker than the beat of drums, they are weaker than a pretty song. Workout to the beats of songs, here is a player I eventually settled on: Professional MP3 HIFI Music Player it costs US $24.80 it is OK, I think. It does not seem Professional, I think it is just because phones are really good these days., The Music Player: Distraction free with easy to push control buttons and large accessible volume knob., Interval Timers: If you need precision use this tool to get a BPM on a song to make a playlist, and if you are still having difficulty with non-stop exercise despite a chain of slow songs, then use a computer to keep track of your rests. I used an Interval Timer from https://www.gymboss.com/ Keep lowering that rest period until no rest is needed in your routine., The Timer: Interval timer will vibrate on start and stop of both exercise and rest. It will count down the number of exercise-rest sequences. By gradually lowering rest period and increasing exercise-rest sequences you will easily increase your endurance., Avoid Counting: Your body will trick you into stopping too early if you rely on counting. Interval Timers remove the distraction of constantly asking \"Is it enough\", and help you switch to \"I will make it to the end\". Use the beat of songs to further distract yourself from quitting. You will not gain endurance if you stop when your body begins hurting, you have to signal your body that is has to adapt because there is no stopping. Remember, you must signal your body that adaptation to exertion is required. You must not allow your body to force you to stop as that will void the exercise and your body will not receive any adaptation signals. No adaptation signals, no change to your strength and endurance., Back Pain: Significant Injuries are more likely if you lift heavy. If you lift heavy a few times, your muscles will not be in a flexible enough state to handle it. Eventually you will pull a muscle, hurt yourself. If you lift 5lb 10,000 times, the chances of getting hurt are much lower. Back pain is still likely to occur, you will need a proper bed, I use the inexpensive PragmaBed, The Bed: Raising your legs, raising your upper body, curving your spine will let your body rest. A flat mattress will attempt to straighten the natural curve to your lower back, in combination with lifting weights for prolonged periods, this is a recipe for disaster. You must let your back-muscles relax., Electrolytes: While our cooling is superior, we do lose electrolytes while we sweat, you need to put them back in. V8 vegetable juice which contains both sodium and potassium is one way to do so, but always with wisdom and in moderation., No Rest: Finally we arrive to the point where I explain why you can’t take days off. Think of your body as a good horse to your mind. Take two horses with muscle atrophy, one walks ten steps three times, every other day weekends off, the other trots for eight and half hours every day for many years, no day off. Which horse would you bet on, which horse would have more muscle, which horse would live healthier?, Playlist: I change my playlist daily, here are some examples. Electro Bounce Boosted Bootleg Bass Boost HIIT Songs Bubblegum Pop Dance Pop Hardstyle Hard Bass Powerstomp Industrial EBM (Electronic body music) Synthpop Witch House Aggrotech Choreography (choreographers tend to pick amazing songs)., Labrinth - Mount Everest - Choreography by Erica Klein, Vocal Ideas: Perhaps some of you may find working out with vocals easier, if so then the Backyard Sessions come to mind., Lilac Wine, Jolene, Meowmix vol. 1,627: Blanco Brown: The Git Up Taylor Swift: Shake It Off Psy: Gangnam Style Davay: Tri Poloski XS Project: Bochka Bass Kolbaser Lil Nas X: Old Town Road Pitbull: Timber Ciara: 1 2 Step Lorde: Royals Fort Minor: Remember The Name Imagine Dragons: Believer Macklemore: Can’t Hold Us Billie Eilish: Bad Guy Kesha: Blow Beyonce: Single Ladies Cascada: Evacuate The Dancefloor Blade: Blade 1 Vampire Dance Club Theme Smile: Butterfly Infernal: From Paris To Berlin XS Project: Expressway Charlie Puth: Betty Boop Caravan Palace: Wonderland Valentino Khan: Pump LMFAO: Sexy and I Know It, Power of Now, Of Focus and Trance: The staying in the moment that he describes can be induced with a fun and snappy playlist, where non-stop endurance bodybuilding is concerned. Ultra-marathons are different from endurance workouts, they take longer and you certainly don’t want to depend on your mp3 player to finish. At the same time ultra-marathons have relative silence and it is easier to focus in the middle of an interesting run., Trainer Song: I also created an Open Source (Free) workout instruction drum song, the mp3 files are available here: https://github.com/westland-valhalla/drums/releases, "

Back in the old days, listeners were\n        not too happy with synthesized songs, people would actually call them UFO\n        Sounds.</p>\n      <p>Some choose to skip sound synthesis and create/<a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Drumkits/\">download</a> samples.\n        Samples can be replayed at different frequencies, depending on which piano\n        key you hit. In fact if you record a single piano key, you can almost\n        recreate the piano entirely by replaying that one piano key at different\n        frequencies/notes (A note like _middle C_, is just a named frequency, in\n        this case 261.63 Hz.)</p>\n      <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)\">Sampling</a> is the art of borrowing a sound, or even a little bit of a song (as in Lofi Hip Hop) and frequently replaying it at a different frequency. You can also sample sounds around you to create unique drums, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-hat\">hats</a>, even piano or some lo-tech violin out of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS4gZcjSHk4\">flinging a doorstop</a>.

In the world of music, that little bit, would often be a defining sound in a song that captured your attention., Amiga Samplers : Budget dance music in 1990, Amen, Break: The Most Sampled Loop in Music History, How sampling transformed music by Mark Ronson, Art of Sampling: Creating sounds with a synthesizer can be tiring, not every sound you synthesize will be ground breaking. Back in the old days, listeners were not too happy with synthesized songs, people would actually call them UFO Sounds. Some choose to skip sound synthesis and create/download samples. Samples can be replayed at different frequencies, depending on which piano key you hit. In fact if you record a single piano key, you can almost recreate the piano entirely by replaying that one piano key at different frequencies/notes (A note like _middle C_, is just a named frequency, in this case 261.63 Hz.) Sampling is the art of borrowing a sound, or even a little bit of a song (as in Lofi Hip Hop) and frequently replaying it at a different frequency. You can also sample sounds around you to create unique drums, hats, even piano or some lo-tech violin out of flinging a doorstop. You can give beatboxing a try and build a song out of sampling/splicing the instruments you imitated with your own voice. Downloadable Drumkits, are collections of short samples of instruments taken from various places, including other songs. Visit r/Drumkits for some free downloads. Additionally, freesound has a huge library, and Splice has a well organized one aimed at musicians for $7.99/mo (the free trial is worth it)., LoFi Synth-Hop, RZA - Flying Birds / Sample Rich Track, RZA'a Samurai Showdown (Lofi Hiphop), Beatboxers, The Science of Dubstep by James Humberstone, How to translate the feeling into sound by Claudio, Become a Rockstar!: Please remember what Claudio teaches us. A song is a story, it is not the back-beat, not the piano, not the twelve inch drum, or the bass head. A song is a story told with voice and music. Grab a pencil, draw a line. Mark all the important events along the line. That's where the lyrics start or end, that's where the back-beat slows or picks up, that's where your listeners will start to laugh or start to cry. We compose music, because the greatest of stories cannot be expressed in words., LMMS: LMMS is a free, cross-platform tool for music composition. Take a look at the showcase, albums of songs made with LMMS., LMMS 1.2, LMMS Tutorial 1: Piano Roll, Beat/Bass Line Editor, LMMS Tutorial 2: Sidebar, LMMS Tutorial 3: TripleOscillator Basics, How to Sing Any Song - Modified Lyrics - Felicia Ricci, How To Sing Any Song - Voice Lessons - Ken Tamplin Vocal Academy, How To Sing With Your Own Voice - Roger Burnley Voice Studio - Singing Vocal Lesson, Anne Reburn: Anne Reburn Channel on YouTube, How Am I Feeling Today?, I'm A Believer, Studio Acapellas: Search YouTube for Studio Acapellas to discover vocal-only tracks of popular songs.

She is almost doing drums with\n          her left hand, she is laying down the beat.</p>\n        <p>Ignore her left hand, now.</p>\n        <p>Look at her right hand, at first she goes up and down. Then she does the\n          pinky &amp; thumb, but still, even though she is playing notes apart, see it as\n          one note, pay attention to thumb only. She does jump between keys, but it\n          is rare and masked by her left hand that is doing the beat.</p>\n        <p>The keys she presses at the same time with her right hand should be seen as\n          one key, she is just mixing two sounds together to create a third sound.\n          When she presses two keys at the same time, she is adding a third key.</p>\n        <p>Why add keys to the piano. Because two keys at the same time sounds richer\n          than pressing one key.</p>\n        <p>Making a single sound out of pressing multiple keys at the same time, is\n          called making a chord.

      "text": "J.K. Rowling: \"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"A magic beyond all we do here!\", Music & Language: You don't need to know musical notation. Musical notation has been replaced by a SAVE BUTTON. No, you do not need to know Musical Notation to read Chopin's Nocturnes, either. You just import the midi file into lmms, and gaze. He is not smarter than you, he just sat at a piano making melodies, wrote them down arranged them in a song, and became famous for having picked nice ones. (Don't listen to people telling you that you can't become a World Famous Maestro, because you don't know notes. They are just salty because they had to learn them, and you don't.) Like languages, music evolved to match our abilities. Everyone is a composer. The rules are very simple. Drums must be low and simple one or two keys. When making melodies don't jump around, transition from one nearby key to another, they are grouped to sound nice together. Break the rules from time to time., Percussion Ensemble, Sounds on a Timeline: Visualize notes as bright little objects on a timeline. Watch the melody., Guitar Hero - Simpsons Theme Song, Melody & Song Structure: Look how keys go together, only when melody gets too boring, is there a huge shift, a kind of a bridge, to get you to the next melody. Notice the Intro, the song does not really start until Ralph Wiggum ends up wearing Jebediah Springfield's Head as a hat. Look how the song has quick melodies, followed by longer key presses, and quick little melodies again. This way none of the parts get boring, and the song keeps going. Notice the Outro. The moment Matt Groening name is displayed, a new variation pops up, and it is a melody that has a very nice closure at the end. It does not seem to leave off unfinished, it hits those four final notes in a sequence, and you know it is done, and done., Musical Form, The Drum Kit: Drums do beat. Beat is what your foot does when you like a song. There will be a rhythm within a song almost always represented by a drum kit. A low deep sound with some stuff happening behind it. That stuff behind it is the drum kit. Listen, The Drum Kit, is just an instrument. If it was just the drums, it would be like a piano with one key. There is more to drums, there are some quick sharp sounding things that go along with it., Play With Your Rhythm: Drum Patterns, The Drum Kit: In general the instrumental sounds that can be created here fall under four basic categories. Kick from A bass drum, or kick drum Snare from the Snare Drum Closed Hat & Open Hat from the Hi-hat Clap, that's the sound that clapping your hands makes., PROFESSIONAL Drum Programming Made EASY in LMMS!, How To Write A Melody On The Piano (For Beginners), The Melody: It hurts my heart to say this lovely woman is doing something wrong. As a Professional Pianist, she is brilliant, but as a teacher, she is a Destroyer of Hopes. Don't listen to a word she says. Watch her hands. She is using both of them. Her left hand is creating low-frequency sounds, and she almost never does anything there, and she keeps things simple. She is almost doing drums with her left hand, she is laying down the beat. Ignore her left hand, now. Look at her right hand, at first she goes up and down. Then she does the pinky & thumb, but still, even though she is playing notes apart, see it as one note, pay attention to thumb only. She does jump between keys, but it is rare and masked by her left hand that is doing the beat. The keys she presses at the same time with her right hand should be seen as one key, she is just mixing two sounds together to create a third sound. When she presses two keys at the same time, she is adding a third key. Why add keys to the piano. Because two keys at the same time sounds richer than pressing one key. Making a single sound out of pressing multiple keys at the same time, is called making a chord. Chords are multiple notes played at the same time, for the purpose of enriching the complexity of what you hear. Left hand does the simple beat, it must always be simple. Right hand does the melody, slowly goes up and down, in this particular video chords aside, she only skips one key to get to the next note. All of this is obscured, because she was taught Music Theory compatible with Mozart & Chopin. You are being taught to break out. Chords are beautiful for sure, but, you just use the recording (the sound sample a .wav/mp3 of the chord) and focus on composition. Melodies are not made by learning how to play a piano. They are made in LMMS by gently moving up and down., Never Fear: You must never fear. There are many theories. Newton, went as far as saying that he made Calculus more complicated than it should be, on purpose. Chopin, would never dare to simplify his work. But that won't stop me., Chopin's Revolutionary Nocturne: undefined, Never Fear, Because You Are a Genius: You can see the same pattern in the video below, it is just rotated 90° clockwise., Chopin - Revolutionary Etude (Op. 10 No. 12), Lead The Way: My Friends, My Readers, play. Revolutionary Warriors. Lead The Way. Let no one stand in it, may they face your wrath. Make your own path. Let no one play you like a piano key. Be the change, you hope to see., "

To log into her dad’s computer she uses the ssh command.\n        ssh is just a program that establishes a secure (encrypted) connection\n        between two computers. She executes ssh alex@192.168.1.27 at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=87\">1:27</a>. And\n        begins using the ssh program.</p>\n      <p>The remote shell, for convenience sake, looks almost the same as her own\n        local shell. Even though very little changes on her screen she is in a\n        full-screen program now, and once she is authenticated her shell prompt\n        changes to that of the remote system. It goes from pi@calebpi ~ $ to\n        []~$[].</p>\n      <p>A shell prompt is the thing that indicates that you are free to type\n        commands. Her dad’s shell prompt is broken, he messed up with whatever was\n        supposed to go in between those square brackets, it maybe that he is using\n        fonts that the Raspberry PI does not have, or some mess like that. My\n        prompt as I write this is [user@computer warrior]$ that means username is\n        user, my computer’s network name is computer, and the directory I am in is\n        warrior.</p>\n      <p>The dollar sign $ indicates that I, alex, and pi are normal users. You can\n        escalate your system privileges to become a system administrator where you\n        can read or delete other user’s files. On most systems the dollar sign\n        would then change to the pound sign # to indicate that care must be taken\n        as you are in special privileges mode, often called <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/R/root.html\">root</a>.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"card-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"card-title\">Warning</h5>\n    <div class=\"card-text\">\n      <p>Now, when the Little Hacker Lady, logs into her dad’s computer she makes it\n        talk using the <strong>say</strong> command.</p>\n      <p>A command is a feature of the Operating System, using commands is a\n        management or administrative task, it is not really true programming, but\n        it is OK to call it that.</p>\n      <p>The say command uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis\">speech synthesis</a> to convert text to speech. The\n        say command resides on her dad’s computer, and thus uses her dad’s speaker.\n        She executes the command at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=310\">5:10</a></p>\n      <p>The command she executes is wonderfully illustrative:</p>\n      <p><strong>say -v serena dad watch out</strong></p>\n      <p>You see that -v that’s a special directive that states when executing the\n        say command use the voice of serena, serena is a cute name for a library of\n        sounds, the say command supports multiple voices, serena is one of them.</p>\n      <p>How do people know that -v means voice, and how do they know that serena\n        is one of the voices? <strong>Nobody knows this at first</strong>, before a person\n        executes a command they read about it in a manual. The manual command is\n        called man and people usually type man followed by the command-name that\n        they want to learn about. In this case: man say (meaning bring up the\n        manual page for the say command). The man page will tell you how you can\n        list all the available voices too (say -v=?), a command like say can do\n        multiple things based on what you are trying to do. Here is the internet\n        version of a man page for say: <a href=\"https://ss64.com/osx/say.html\">https://ss64.com/osx/say.html</a></p>\n      <p>People are not happy with this. Many try to create simplified man pages,\n        here is one example <a href=\"https://tldr.sh/\">https://tldr.sh/</a> but it is always best to go to\n        the source, and just get used to the man command.</p>\n      <p>She didn’t need to use the serena voice library, she could have just\n        executed:</p>\n      <p><strong>say dad watch out</strong></p>\n      <p>And the say command would use the default voice. The say command is mostly\n        available on Macs, Raspberry Pi will likely use the espeak command.</p>\n      <p><strong>espeak &quot;dad watch out&quot;</strong></p>\n      <p>Espeak command is slightly different, for it gets confused by multiple\n        words, you have to join them together by wrapping them in quotes. A\n        programmer should demand that his program code has good hygiene. eSpeak\n        simply said “I am not just going to read everything that you type at me”\n        whereas the programmer that made the say command said “Let’s just assume\n        that whatever they throw at us needs to be converted to speech unless\n        something starts with a hyphen”. The say command makes assumptions, whereas\n        espeak is very strict about input.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"card-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"card-title\">The Kill -9</h5>\n    <div class=\"card-text\">\n      <p>At <a href=\"https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=229\">3:49</a> the Little Lady Hacker explains that she will be shutting down\n        her dad’s code editor, and writes down the Process ID number 95251. Mac\n        users frequently use <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text</a> code editor. She issues the kill\n        command with the -9 switch, this is a terrible idea, as it basically\n        crashes her dad’s code editor and the -9 ensures there is no way to save\n        data. Here is the man page for the kill command\n        <a href=\"https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill\">https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill</a>. Unix programs that are actively\n        running are called processes (as in a program that is processing something)\n        and each process has a number. The kill command can be used during\n        development and debugging, in a reboot scenario, or when battery is about\n        to die on a laptop, it has its proper uses. As a joke, it is already bad\n        enough to use the kill command on a process as it sends a TERM[inate]\n        signal.

      "text": "What is a Hacker? with Emmanuel Goldstein., Kids hack their Dad's computer on her Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi: The $35 Raspberry Pi is the most handsome in a class of computers called Single-board computers. They just released version 4, so make sure you get that one; and don’t forget a monitor. BestBuy does sell the PI, packaged in the Raspberry Pi 4 Cana Kit. Personally, I think getting the original keyboard and mouse is really cool, I am not a fan of the plastic case and would go for a cool looking Heat Sink “Case” - and then probably short something out. Good news is that ashens has a two part review of all the popular cases here you go: Part 1 and Part 2. Heads up, ashens is an odd British man that utters odd British phrases., Raspberry Pi 4, What's inside the Raspberry Pi 4 Desktop Kit?, Portable Monitor: undefined, Monitors: There is a class of monitors called Portable Monitors it is still nice to have a desk one, but if you are wondering which one to get; get a portable first (the cheapest one is $99), then you can take it to Starbucks, plug in your PI, keyboard and mouse, and headphones; and compose some music with LMMS whilst pondering album art with GIMP., Screen Projector: Don't forget about Projectors as those too are a kind of monitor (the cheap ones are $50 - $75). A projector turns any wall into a monitor., Heist: She likley stole her daddy’s dad’s password by using her older brother’s key logger. To log into her dad’s computer she uses the ssh command. ssh is just a program that establishes a secure (encrypted) connection between two computers. She executes ssh alex@192.168.1.27 at 1:27. And begins using the ssh program. The remote shell, for convenience sake, looks almost the same as her own local shell. Even though very little changes on her screen she is in a full-screen program now, and once she is authenticated her shell prompt changes to that of the remote system. It goes from pi@calebpi ~ $ to []~$[]. A shell prompt is the thing that indicates that you are free to type commands. Her dad’s shell prompt is broken, he messed up with whatever was supposed to go in between those square brackets, it maybe that he is using fonts that the Raspberry PI does not have, or some mess like that. My prompt as I write this is [user@computer warrior]$ that means username is user, my computer’s network name is computer, and the directory I am in is warrior. The dollar sign $ indicates that I, alex, and pi are normal users. You can escalate your system privileges to become a system administrator where you can read or delete other user’s files. On most systems the dollar sign would then change to the pound sign # to indicate that care must be taken as you are in special privileges mode, often called root., Warning: Now, when the Little Hacker Lady, logs into her dad’s computer she makes it talk using the say command. A command is a feature of the Operating System, using commands is a management or administrative task, it is not really true programming, but it is OK to call it that. The say command uses speech synthesis to convert text to speech. The say command resides on her dad’s computer, and thus uses her dad’s speaker. She executes the command at 5:10 The command she executes is wonderfully illustrative: say -v serena dad watch out You see that -v that’s a special directive that states when executing the say command use the voice of serena, serena is a cute name for a library of sounds, the say command supports multiple voices, serena is one of them. How do people know that -v means voice, and how do they know that serena is one of the voices? Nobody knows this at first, before a person executes a command they read about it in a manual. The manual command is called man and people usually type man followed by the command-name that they want to learn about. In this case: man say (meaning bring up the manual page for the say command). The man page will tell you how you can list all the available voices too (say -v=?), a command like say can do multiple things based on what you are trying to do. Here is the internet version of a man page for say: https://ss64.com/osx/say.html People are not happy with this. Many try to create simplified man pages, here is one example https://tldr.sh/ but it is always best to go to the source, and just get used to the man command. She didn’t need to use the serena voice library, she could have just executed: say dad watch out And the say command would use the default voice. The say command is mostly available on Macs, Raspberry Pi will likely use the espeak command. espeak \"dad watch out\" Espeak command is slightly different, for it gets confused by multiple words, you have to join them together by wrapping them in quotes. A programmer should demand that his program code has good hygiene. eSpeak simply said “I am not just going to read everything that you type at me” whereas the programmer that made the say command said “Let’s just assume that whatever they throw at us needs to be converted to speech unless something starts with a hyphen”. The say command makes assumptions, whereas espeak is very strict about input., The Kill -9: At 3:49 the Little Lady Hacker explains that she will be shutting down her dad’s code editor, and writes down the Process ID number 95251. Mac users frequently use Sublime Text code editor. She issues the kill command with the -9 switch, this is a terrible idea, as it basically crashes her dad’s code editor and the -9 ensures there is no way to save data. Here is the man page for the kill command https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill. Unix programs that are actively running are called processes (as in a program that is processing something) and each process has a number. The kill command can be used during development and debugging, in a reboot scenario, or when battery is about to die on a laptop, it has its proper uses. As a joke, it is already bad enough to use the kill command on a process as it sends a TERM[inate] signal. As a programmer you can add a signal handler in your program, and then in case of TERM signal you can for example ask the user to save his data, the TERM signal is an advisory. The -9 sends a KILL signal. There is no handler for the KILL signal, there is no saving work, the process is destroyed by the Operating System, whatever he was working on is lost. She executes kill -9 95251 at 5:26 his code editor disappears instantly. Yikes!, All Your Base Are Belong To Us: Lookup All Your Base Are Belong To Us over at the Jargon File, Jargon File: There is a wee bit of jargon here, but don’t worry. ESR is managing a jargon file you can read at http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/go01.html and he has a cool HOWTO on hackers from which I quote below: What Is a Hacker? There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and networking wizards that traces its history back through decades to the first time-sharing minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments.

Software hackers recognize these kindred spirits elsewhere and may call them ‘hackers’ too — and some claim that the hacker nature is really independent of the particular medium the hacker works in. There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but aren't. These are people (mainly adolescent males, and little girls) who get a kick out of breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system. Real hackers call these people ‘crackers’ and want nothing to do with them. Real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not very bright, and object that being able to break security doesn't make you a hacker any more than being able to hot-wire cars makes you an automotive engineer. Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word ‘hacker’ to describe crackers; this irritates real hackers no end. The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break them.”, The Glider: undefined, Hacker Logo: This is a glider, a bit of a symbol for hackers, who are like cats, and do not like each other, herds, or stupid little symbols., A look at a glider: undefined, Gliders: The glider comes from Conway’s Game of Life the little things manufactured by Gospers glider gun and walking off towards lower right are gliders in action.), Game of Life and the Gliders: undefined, Cellular Automaton: Gliders, are of the world of Cellular Automaton, you have heard Murray Gell-Mann talk about it in context of Emergence the Game of Life is a little simulation of playing with Fundamental Principles, and Accidents.

To disable the underline mode, you simply remove the -u. Then we have\n        the extended argument &quot;--format&quot; followed by a directive &quot;capitalize&quot;.\n        Supported directives can be found in documentation.</p>\n      <p>print -u --format capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</p>\n      <p>To make things easier to type, most commands allow short form of extended\n        arguments, so --format can become -f.</p>\n      <p>print -u -f capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</p>\n      <p>Conversely, most one letter arguments/flags have an extended form that\n        begins with two hyphens. Note how -u changed to --underline.</p>\n      <p>print --underline -f capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</p>\n      <p>For clarity and readability, I recommend using extended forms.</p>\n      <p>print --underline --format capitalize &quot;hello world&quot;</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"card-body\">\n    <h5 class=\"card-title\">Why would anyone want to apply a Command-line interface to something?</h5>\n    <div class=\"card-text\">\n      <p>Because of the uniformity of command syntax.

If you use a file manager with a graphic user interface (GUI), then you don't need to worry about these., File Compression Commands: A group of commands for compressing files to save space gzip, tar, and bzip2 to name a few., File Download Command: Some commands are so good at what they do there is only a couple of them wget and curl are a good example of that. cURL downloads files really well, it is also very frequently used for debugging or testing web-servers that serve files, it is a very efficient program. wget is awesome at resuming downloads and downloading large files, it actually has a feature that not only downloads a web page, but also all the images and other web pages that are linked to it. There are also some really eyebrow raising commands like youtube-dl which comes with an --extract-audio argument, meaning, it will make an mp3 out of a video. I don't know what Alphabet's Terms of Service state on the subject of downloading their data. I don't recommend you use this command, unless you familiarize yourself with their Terms of Service, specifics of downloading content with third-party tools, and own the content yourself. Note that it is not just a YouTube account that may get suspended, but all the rest too, gmail and google docs, stuff on your android phone, etc. Here is what the command would look for a YouTube Creator hoping to make a backup of a particular video. youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR\\_VIDEO\\_ID And here is the code for saving just the audio it self, this is useful for making an audio only version of an adventure video or remixing your content in a song. youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR\\_VIDEO\\_ID Look how simple and easy to read. Commands can save you from thousands of mouse clicks and hours of annoying, repetitive work. Commands are a beautiful invention. Graphic user interfaces are helpful when learning computers, but eventually they will force you into a world of clicks., Commands Are Friends!: It is so awesome to just open a terminal, type in gmail alice@aol.com -s \"About Cybertruck\" -m \"So did you get the $69K build?\" and go have your Irish Breakfast Tea (or an Earl Gray with an extra lump of sugar and an extended pinkie) a whole 35 seconds earlier, because you didn't have to wait for the mail window to open and start sucking memory whilst inspecting its innards., How To Hack Time, Simplicity Lost: Originally, the beauty of commands was in being predictable, readable, and not causing surprises. UNIX style operating systems, are well thought out. But, people will cram a lot more than they should, and it gets out of control, here is a mild example of mixing some video files with the ffmpeg command. ffmpeg -i test1.avi -i test2.avi -vcodec copy -acodec copy -vcodec copy -acodec copy test12.avi -newvideo -newaudio I have some guesses as to what the ff stands for. You can visit the manual page here: https://linux.die.net/man/1/ffmpeg, Pipes: There is a feature in the command world, that can deal with high complexity, and that is the pipe. Meaning two commands can be connected by a pipe in the following manner print \"hello world\" | uppercase This would result in changing all text to uppercase, and printing it on the screen. HELLO WORLD, Redirects: There is also a feature of pipes that creates files and that is the greater than symbol \">\". print \"hello world\" | uppercase > greetings.txt This would result in changing all text to uppercase too, but instead of seeing \"HELLO WORLD\" on the screen we’d see it in the file named greetings.txt, User Interface: While Pipes and Redirects of the Command Line are often enough. A number of Graphical Pipe Editors exists as well, Node-RED is a nice example., Node-RED, Recap and Summary: In The Wizard chapter we learned not to confuse the operating system, with the user interface; as those are two separate kinds of computer programs. Now we learn that UNIX is an operating system with a user interface classified as the Command-line interface, let us take a closer look at the command-line interface., Uniformity of Commands: Once you learn the shape that a command can take, you will be able to use any command on any system. Let us proceed with an imaginary command \"print\" that has some extra features., Command Documentation: Most well behaved commands can be executed with the --help argument, or the -h flag to print some helpful documentation. print --help Popular commands will come with manual pages that can be read with the man command. In this case we would execute: man print, The Simplest Form: In the following example there is one argument \"hello world\". Without quotes the command would see two arguments \"hello\" and \"world\". Quotes are used to join two or more things together. print \"hello world\", The Extended Form: In the next example we have a Boolean flag \"-u\" meaning enable underline mode. To disable the underline mode, you simply remove the -u. Then we have the extended argument \"--format\" followed by a directive \"capitalize\". Supported directives can be found in documentation. print -u --format capitalize \"hello world\" To make things easier to type, most commands allow short form of extended arguments, so --format can become -f. print -u -f capitalize \"hello world\" Conversely, most one letter arguments/flags have an extended form that begins with two hyphens. Note how -u changed to --underline. print --underline -f capitalize \"hello world\" For clarity and readability, I recommend using extended forms. print --underline --format capitalize \"hello world\", Why would anyone want to apply a Command-line interface to something?: Because of the uniformity of command syntax. Once you know how to run one command, you know how to run them all. You just need to pull up the documentation to see what all the commands are and what arguments they accept., What other complex systems can the Command-line interface be successfully applied to?: Any complex system can be controlled through a command-line interface., Your Car: lights --highbeams on lights --highbeams off dashboard --engine-light off glovebox --lock passw0rd1 glovebox --unlock passw0rd1, Your House: lights --off stove --off thermostat --heat 72 coffeemaker --on 6AM, Office Shenanigans: Please read github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts Which \"hack\" this poor bastard's coffemaker, soon to be ruined romantic life, a particularly needy customer, and alcoholism. Based on a true story, apparently. Please note how the community of geeks that love this story came together and started re-creating these \"hacker\" scripts in the programming languages they favor; probably out of sadness. Here is the Node.js Version of fucking_coffee.js. Note that once the telnet connection is established at line number 22, we begin using the coffeemaker command-line interface: sys brew (line 26), sys pour (line 32). Don't think of the coffeemaker as running UNIX, just think of it as it being controlled by a command line interface somewhere. Any machine with a button or two is a system with enough complexity to benefit from a command-line interface. Note how you have never programmed a coffeemaker before, and yet you know precisely - and may even remember for months to come - the commands \"sys brew\" and \"sys pour\". sys brew sys pour It seems sys is a single command that looks at the first text argument. Executing sys -h would probably print: Coffemaker Help ---- -h / --help print this text -v / --verbose print debugging information -b / --brew / or simply brew start brewing -p / --pour / or simply pour start pouring -r / --reboot / or simply reboot reboot the system ... Lack of proper etiquette, and using text (brew) instead of arguments (--brew/-b) can be an indication of sys being a script that does not take the time to parse anything it just looks at the first thing after the command name. It is actually difficult to parse arguments (-b/--brew), it takes no effort at all to use raw text (brew)., Smart Coffeemaker: Mr. Coffee Smart Coffeemaker enabled with WeMo can be controlled with the bootleg node.js client for WeMo found on github. As a bonus, you can control burn down you entire house, plus the Coffeemaker., Smarter Coffeemaker: I was unable to locate the coffeemaker from the story. Personally I'd just stick a Raspberry PI into a cheap one and make my own sys command (with proper argument parsing). If you are courageous enough to do this, might as well install a small web server, stream the coffeemaker using the camera board module, and let people brew you one for a small fee of $9.95 while you blog about the experience on the PI it self., "

This must be a live, fully functioning shop that you built for a client. A case study for the above Shopify website that details your experiences on the project. You will need to provide an overview of the project and the client. A cover letter. A link to your design portfolio. How we review your application For the active Shopify website our review will cover: Problem solving ability (the solution outlined in the case study is visible). Originality (the shop is using a custom theme, not a free or paid theme from the Shopify Theme Store). Art direction (choice of photography, images, icons, color, and overall originality). Layout (flow of content, hierarchy, balance, contrast, white space, responsiveness, grid, and alignment). Typography (font pairings, font sizes, line spacing, hierarchy of text, number of fonts used, and legibility of text). Consistency in design patterns (between pages and on a single page). Accessibility (hover states, colour ratios, and touch targets). Customer UX (purchase flow through the collection, product, and cart pages). Technical ability (up-to-date with Shopify platform, website functionality, code consistency, and lack of errors). For the case study we will be looking for you to provide this information: What brought the client to you? What were the client’s needs? How did you go about solving their problem? We would like to see your research, your workflow (prototyping and refining), and what you learned. For the cover letter we would like to see the following information: An outline of who you (and your team) are. Why you want to join the Shopify Theme Partner community? Why you think you’d do well as a Theme Partner? Feel free to put your own personal touch or spin on the cover letter. We highly value originality, enthusiasm, and motivation when considering applications. For the design portfolio we will be reviewing the same design related points as mentioned above for the active Shopify website: Art direction. Layout. Typography. Consistency. The Shopify Theme Partnerships team is not able to provide detailed feedback on why an application does not pass our review process. If we do reach out to you about becoming a potential Theme Partner, we will work with you on the next steps of the approval process. Your theme in the Shopify Theme Store Once a theme has been built and approved, it may only be distributed via the Theme Store. Please do not distribute your theme on other marketplaces or third-party channels, or try to take customers away from the Theme Store. Theme support If there is a technical issue with your theme (for example: broken layout, dead link, logic error) you will be responsible for fixing the issue in a timely fashion. Critical bugs must be fixed immediately or your theme may be temporarily removed from the Theme Store. Theme Partners are responsible for supporting merchants who use their theme(s). You will need to provide a public support email address, theme documentation, and assist merchants with their theme-related questions. Themes will be removed from the Theme Store if they have made less than 25 sales in a 3 month time period. Theme Partners are responsible for keeping their themes up-to-date with core Shopify features and any improved standards Shopify implements in the future. These can include improvements to the overall user experience, the user interface, accessibility, and more., The Challenge: Now, a job making themes for Shopify is great for a Web Design start-up struggling to get customers, as 160 sales would get them $20K, after the 30% cut (of $8,640). But for an outsider looking in, it is just a look into the world of professional web development, and never-ending bug fixing. Aside from regular bugs, both code-bases (bootstrap and shopify) are under active development, that is a lot of code updates. There is a smaller but streamlined theme sales platform, with more reasonable restrictions. Take a look at the sales stats that they parade right at their front page. At 48,623 sales priced at $44 USD, the INSPINIA - Responsive Admin Theme would have made 2.2 million USD. Even if WrapBootstrap took 50% of that, the developer took a million home. Now remember INSPINIA is sitting right on top of Bootstrap so all this development is going on in the back at no charge to INSPINIA Developers. All they do is add more components, and keep up with the latest updates to the Bootstrap code base., A Software Developer's Secret to Life by Julia Menchavez, Services Platform: The Web Developer, that you need to become creates the streamlined, low-liability versions of wrapbootstrap.com, themes.shopify.com, or even shopify.com it self, and others that tickle your fancy in similar ways. Now when I went to the website of INSPINIA developers, I got redirected to wrapbootstrap.com. This may mean - and in deed it would make perfect sense that WrapBootstrap made INSPINIA. This would also mean that they made 2.2 Million Dollars, they pocketed 100% of those sales ([3rd party sellers earn 80%]4). Your story may be even more elaborate than this. You maybe taking a step above the platforms, and sell a service where a person can rent a platform like wrapbootstrap.com or themes.shopify.com for a monthly membership fee and a reasonable percentage of sales., Become a CEO: Web Developer, is a huge step. But making themes is not it. It is not even about learning programming, though you should definitely know about it; because you need a team of programmers to develop your sales platform(s). It is about becoming a Businessperson with a plan. In other words, a Founder, a CEO. You shouldn't think of a web developer as a person that merely develops for the web, think of one as a developer of the web. That is a difference between $180 and $2,200,000, a resume and an outstanding portfolio, an employee and an employer, bugfixes and excitement., "

      "text": "Hans Zimmer - interview influences and backgrounds, Elon Musk knocks the college experience, Notes from an Imaginary High School: A Quick Reminder: We knew there was no conspiracy, no deliberate ill intent, no plan to betray a student for a paycheck. Many of the teachers were our friends, family, people we admired. Many felt bad about the level of education we were receiving. But, whether they liked it or not, consciously or subconsciously, at the end of the day, it was clear that the teachers were forcing us to memorize for long enough to pass standardized testing, and the administration didn't have a problem with that., De-Grading Education by Elizabeth Wissner-Gross, Paved with Good Intentions: They meant no harm, they did it so that they could get paid, so that the school could get funding, so that everyone would keep their job. But those who didn't rise against it caused harm. They interfered with our real education, harming creativity, erasing individuality. In K-12 they taught us that delicate hearts belonged with mommy at home, that bullies were a fact, and life is never fair. They hurt our hearts, and shamed us by saying. \"Oh, just grow up, already! Because, you need to improve your grades.\", The Surprising Truth About Learning in Schools by Will Richardson, We Were Mislead: \"Today, we'll get it all working, and today we'll get paid. Tomorrow, tomorrow, when everything is worked-out and working, we'll get to the students - one thing at a time.\" - They'd say. But we knew that tomorrow never comes, once the new day starts, it is already today. The tomorrow they thought of, was more of a garbage can for nice-to-haves. They were working very hard, and it was all very hard work. But they didn't have the strength to do both, their job, and make schools work. In effect, everyone forgot about us. They forgot we were the point and the future. Their aim was no longer our education, but merely staying in business by arranging for what in effect became, an impression of one., Twists & Turns: To accomplish all this, some changes needed to be made, they first convinced themselves that they were doing a great job so as long as they were working hard, and then some things needed to be taken away, and a few needed to be twisted around. We were forced to recognize that teachers work really, really hard, that the administration works very hard, it is all hard work, extremely stressful. People give up days off, cancel vacations, make sacrifices. To question administration or teachers while they work that hard, makes for a heartless, cruel, shameful petty little student., Nataly Buhr, undefined: undefined, How Unfortunate... : \"Focus on the positive, on how hard we work and how far we've come together.\" - They'd say, ever so lovingly. Void of context, many of the shallow arguments the teachers made could almost stand up to a proper debate. But we remained unconvinced because teaching is not just a job. It is not an ordinary job, and it is not just about knowledge., Teaching is Complex: Teaching requires that the Teacher first comprehends each of the Students, understands their existing body of knowledge, manner of learning, and finds a way to genuinely communicate with them. Tracking is not that hard, a pencil or a Concept Mapping tool will do., Concept Mapping with Cmap, Teaching is Complex and Rewarding: Teaching should respectfully extend their existing knowledge. The teacher must know if fascination with Dinosaurs will head towards Paleontology, Biology, Ecology, and keep an eye on progression of that path (if said path continues) to see is they have a Cell Bilogist, Astrobiologist, Evolutionary Biologist, or maybe a Writer, in their class. The complexity of teaching may actually scale with the reward, how fantastic it must be to help our Dino Girl to ponder inter-planetary cross-contamination from the Chicxulub crater and witness her journey lean towards Astrobiology and an internship at NASA/ESA, possibly a career. Now, pushing her away from what moves her, grading her down for it, and forcing her to memorize whatever is in the curriculum so that she may pass the grade. That is something else... And the answer to how many children were hurt this way, is: all of them, in every school, on every continent, in every country, state and district. Schools interrupt education. They destroy careers, passions, inspirations, talents, and genius. They do it just a split second before the Kids know how to protect it. They destroy The Shy, The Delicate, The Compassionate. They destroy Pacifists, Leaders, Scientists, Inventors, Dreamers, Poets, Artists, Sculptors, Musicians, Adventures, Writers, Makers, Heroes., undefined: A picture of a real blackboard in a library taken from F**k Grades by Denise Dutton. Prof. Dutton does not postulate a 2.* GPA student in her talk. I think the person that wrote this was a young woman. And this might have been her last act of defiance in that school. We lost a wise and delicate being, a leader, a scientist, maybe a writer, to silence, rejection, shunning. That late-night scribble is clear Evidence of Exceptional Ability. This is someone we each admire, someone Beautifully Courageous. But she left, she's gone. They gave her a 2.0 for Leadership, Unbreakability, Heroism, for spending her last semester reading books she loved, at the school library she loved, right before getting thrown out. Thrown out by people that didn't know what they were doing, but they sure as hell worked hard at doing it. Thrown out for unobstructed pursuit of Wisdom., Lux Et Veritas (Enlightenment and Authenticity): Above all, school is a place of healing, it is a sacred place. The School Library is even more sacred, it is a place for Young Philosophers. School is about safety and security and protection, first. It must be a place where we can safely grow, study both Life, and Wisdom. Search for Enlightenment and Authenticity. Education is about mental health, learning to live. Learning to avoid what is not life. Not starting at zero, but rather resuming at where the greatest minds left off. The teachers were supposed to work for us first. Only upon genuinely enabling us to comprehend new things, should they be rewarded., How Evil...: Alas, teaching whilst failing to educate, is fraud. Parading the coffee lovers, who want to breeze through with a 4.0 GPA, to get the hell out, and move past this damn charade. Parading them as successfully educated students, is fraud. Making the quiet girl cry because she wanted to comprehend and not merely memorize, is evil. Turning face away, when the fat kid is being bullied, beaten, assaulted, threatened, kicked, held down, spat upon, is evil. Sending a kid back home, when you just witnessed his father beating him in the bathroom for the bad grades he ended up with, because he can't memorize anything when he is under constant threat from everybody, is evil. Failing to authentically educate, and then grading down those who rejected the memorization dog and pony show, is evil. Pretending to teach under the poisonous threat of repeating the grade or year, semester or class, threatening kids to stop learning, and start memorizing, is evil. Sending kids home to angry, often violent parents, because they rejected fake education, fake tests, fantasy GPA, is evil., Do schools kill creativity? by Sir Ken Robinson, Toxic, Fractured, Hoop Jumping: School doesn't just kill creativity, genius, talent, inspiration and passion, it kills learning too. The toxic mixture of irrelevant babble, easy to cram for tests, and Life & Career threatening GPA; forces the student to abandon Authentic Education for curriculum-hoop jumping., F**k Grades by Denise Dutton, We Were All Geniuses, We Were Mislead: We were taught that genius is rare, that creativity is reserved for those who have talent, that good grades get a good job, that only the smart ace the tests, and that to pass a test we need to cram harder and take more notes, that grade-point-average is the measure of a human - because that is how the world works. And work... Work would set us free. We were scared, because there was no road ahead. There was no clear authentic future. Not without that same charade, that inauthenticity, that glass of fashion, that mold of form that we were being pressed into, and everyone else already accepted, and blindly participated in., Erica Goldson, Trigonometry, Triceps and Triceratops: At first we thought we were the losers. We certainly had the grades to prove it. We formed a club. We sarcastically called it The Breakfast Club after an old movie. We expected to be held back, and eventually kicked out. We didn't expect to be seen as the gifted ones. But we had the gift of courage, the gift of search for a clear road ahead. And that road turned out to be becoming a Businessperson, a Founder, a CEO. It was a path that mixed education with rewards, leading onward to independence and a majestic triumph, albeit through many a failure. In school, we were being forced to memorize Trigonometry, Triceps and Triceratops, when what we really needed was help with finding investors to scale our little Breakfast Club business., How School Makes Kids Less Intelligent by Eddy Zhong, The Courageous & The Fallen: The others secretly saw us as courageous, strong and unbreakable, healthy and authentic. But they didn't really know how to relate to us. We were the same but they were too confused by the noise of homework, quizzes, tests, and grades, chores, parents, circles, and punishment, punishment everywhere. The threat of repeating classes, reliving the same noise, or being held back was exactly like prison. Neurologically, Threat and Punishment interferes with Neurogenesis. For the most Delicate, it wasn't just difficult to cram and memorize, it might have been neurologically impossible., Mad World, Our Club, Angelheaded Hipsters: The biggest of the troublemakers had the most brittle souls, they were the first to shine, the mightiest of the thinkers, the best of the survivors, but tragically also the first to have their spark dim under threat and pressure. Already forged in battle at home, the betrayal of schooling was the tipping point for many. They just couldn't resist parents, or pressure, or grades, not for that long, it was not human to live perpetually frightened in constant fear. The schools added to the dark forces already crushing them, the teachers were supposed to kindle their flame, but they filled their vessel and often extirpated their spark., Allen Ginsberg: I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix, angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night..., We Didn't Forget About The Fallen: We'd see it the moment it happened, overnight they'd end up switching crowds. The teachers, who were supposed to be their protectors, and their hope and inspiration, would eventually notice the transition as well, but perversely they would think to themselves \"I was correct, I always knew that one was a loser too.\", The Club, People tried to help, but they didn't know how.: Someone said that the only reason the teachers seemed to know more than we did, was because they had to regurgitate that same stuff every year to keep their jobs... Each time it came up; there was always someone to say that they wanted to help us, but in the end they seemed to have wanted to assimilate and destroy, embrace and extinguish. Get the gifted ones out of the system to make things easier for themselves, to calm the waters - if nothing sticks out, it must be all good. Nobody, really, took grades seriously because of how easy it was to cram before a test, pass it, and forget it. Since tests did not represent student knowledge, grades did not represent the student.

Overwhelming majority of Teachers didn't want to change anything because they didn't want to make their job any harder, they just want to get paid and go home. Statistically half of them quit anyway. Management was focused on grade points and funding. Everybody else was parading solutions, but there was no time, any extras were aimed at symptoms, extras just added to the weight of existing problems. The root cause was that we were not safe, and we were not learning., Waiting For Superman, We Set Ourselves Free, to Live Authentic, to Invent, to Triumph.: We accepted the responsibility for our own education. We begun learning on our own, through internet, Audio Books, trial and error. We begun building more and more small companies, and the more we failed the wiser we became. The moment schools begun interfering with our companies, with making money that we used to support ourselves, we became dropouts. But we did look back, we aimed to fix Education. To make all those countless forgotten aches and pains count., We Changed The World: At first, nobody wanted to talk to us. There was a problem with how Investors viewed people who paraded their GPA or even completed schools. The Investors didn't want followers, and above all they didn't want cheaters that tried to pass their GPA as something authentic or even meaningful. The Investors sought Natural Born Leaders, they sought Evidence of Exceptional Ability. The Investors sought people who rejected the inauthenticity of broken education and didn't partake in stupid charades. It was almost like High School became a mechanism to keep the administration busy, the teachers blind, the students poor, and the parents dreaming., The Fierce & Authentic: Staying in school had a negative impact on our education, on our futures. College and Premed brought sleep deprivation into the farce, it was a dangerous joke. In the end all we had was our friendship. The school was tearing us apart, the Start-ups kept us together. Looking back at how young we were, how unbreakable, how fierce. Though we didn't believe in schools, we doubted ourselves for years. Now, looking back, we searched for mentors, but none were to be found. But, in the absence of teachers, we became the teachers. To quote an old commercial: We were The Crazy Ones, The Misfits, The Rebels, The Troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes, the ones who saw things differently, who were not fond of rules, and had no respect for the status quo. We were the ones crazy enough to think we could change the world... ... and we did ..., "

      "text": "Why most students are getting the least out of school by Dan Cardinali, Poverty Of Mind Comes From Lack Of Non Cognitive Skills: Dan Cardinali's definition of Non Cognitive Skills includes the following: Building grit, and resilience, and persistence, and self-regulation. He's describing skills of a Warrior, a Fighter, an Authentic Grown Up. Dan Cardinali explains that ideally families should provide Non Cognitive Skills (Child Development), and then schools will deliver Academic Development (Math, History, Physics). But this is not how it works today, well to do parents are too busy, parents stricken by poverty can't have time, and non-cognitive skill development is not only unavailable, but is often laughed at by teachers \"Parents do your job.\" they brainlessly utter. Above all, a child born to the culture of poverty (lacking non-cognitive skills) will often remain in the culture of poverty be it dropping out or graduation. The steps out and up are just too far apart., undefined: How dare you. How. Dare. You. Image from The Surprising Truth About Learning in Schools by Will Richardson, The Battle Against Poverty of Mind: It is correct to say that Poverty of Mind is rooted in lack of Non Cognitive Skills. An example of poverty of mind is inability to have an expensive lunch with an internship company CEO. Out of fear of not knowing EVERYTHING! from how to get a table to when to order, or even if it is OK to just have the cute little bagel and focus on the questionnaire. Lunch, if not impossible, can be impossibly terrifying. There is no breaking out of poverty when every-step induces fear, confusion, anxiety. To be clear, the ultimate aim for both Student and Principal. Almost always, is to rise and break away, become a CEO. Become an inspiration and a teacher; to make life more. To then retire come the Golden Age of Wisdom and write. Write about the lessons that counted to make them last even longer. Create an Audio Book in your own voice in hopes of it being used 50 years from now to Rise & Learn to Really Learn. What an Honor to have your spirit revived by means of Admiration and Love, your own voice across decades, maybe centuries, maybe forever. Instead, the children are getting scared, mostly because they can see schools are forcing irrelevant learning that fades away. It is impossible to retain irrelevant knowledge. In context of education, forcing irrelevant knowledge and grading a student down for lack of retention is evil. And here the child does not want the job because it has too many complications, can't even have the internship lunch because it is too terrifying, and can't conceive of the notion of connecting with the CEO in such a way as to eventually resign position and start a company in a similar sector. They are scared, sometimes crushed, but far too brave to show you... Principal. We know what happens to most young people that can't handle fear or depression., The Power of a Teacher by Adam Saenz, A Place of Healing: Be it by intent or ignorance, anybody taking part in the fracturing of minds, and young minds especially, is just another monster. A school must become a place of healing before it can hope to teach. It must protect against all kinds of poverty, and bad parents, dangerous culture and bad ideas. Today school is a bad place. Just another broken promise., Elon Musk knocks the college experience, Elon Musk: [My] recruiting does not have anything that says \"Requires University\" because that's absurd, but there is a requirement of evidence of exceptional ability. [...] I don't consider going to college evidence of exceptional ability in fact ideally you dropped out and did something [exceptional]., The Battle Against Poverty of Mind: What can be easier than to help a child grow? what can be more rewarding than to be Admired, Loved, Remembered?

The Children are not your means to staying in business and getting paid- that would make you a Monster and a Fraud. The best way to fight poverty in a person's mind, is to set a student up for a job so high up, that it will make them want to run out of the school quietly-yelling and hope they never need to come back. A prestigious position at a local Hospital as a Research Nurse that keeps everyone informed a month ahead of time, a complicated job at the Library of Congress, or as Someone Amazing at the Detroit Institute of Arts. Set a step so high, that it is already a healthy career but completely unreachable to the child, the step up being, Just Impossible. And then slowly, build.

And everybody else, to grow up, all the way up, until we become a generation after a generation of great beings. Growing up is not optional. Growing all the way up, is not optional. It is our Health, it is our Right. It is the only way to break out, and bring about our hopes and dreams of the future., Waiting For the Champions, Waiting For the Champions: \"It is hard to teach kids who stink.\" We must face the misjudgment of the role of poverty in education. We must face the misjudgment of the the gravity of poverty. We must face policy that does not make sense, that will never make sense, due to persistent malformed-understanding of education. Education begins in kindergarten, it is easy to forget this. It begins with mentors, inspiration, friendship. There is no education without human connection, but there is merit in apps, computer programs, videos, audio books, and overhead internet satellites. We need a clear aim, for both, educators, and the kids. There is no clearer aim than becoming a Business Creator, and escaping poverty. Rising to no end in sight. Eventually leaving a worthy legacy.

It is easy to believe the lie, that we can stop because we are not learning fast enough, or we know enough, or got enough; or had enough. It is easy to misunderstand the purpose of Education. We don't need a generation of Brilliant and Unstoppable Teachers, or Policy Makers. Oh, there will never be enough of those; and there is already far too many. Pretending to be wise and authentic is far too easy, to put the future of humanity in someone else's hands. Even if it wasn't a fantasy aimed to place responsibility for education elsewhere, there is no good reason to wait for Policy Makers to update policy. We must teach children that they are responsible for their own education, and their own exit from poverty, by means of becoming a business creator. Children need an aim, before they open the textbook. They need persistent enlightenment. Not moronic excuses that they won't always have a calculator at hand, or sick fantasies of a happy job they will always love performing.

Today, the help is effectively stuck, they are not coming to help you. Education has reached a point where it can help you memorize, but the actual learning probably has to be done prior to taking a class. The teachers can't yet help you, they can't help you meaningfully learn and fully integrate at a fast enough pace. Do not relinquish control over your education, knowledge, wisdom, individuality, and decision making. Your own future, is in your own hands. Grow up, grow all the way up. Become a Great Being. Rise, accept the responsibility for your own education, your own exploration. Accept the responsibility for your own triumph over poverty. Accept the responsibility for your own existence. Decades from now, with your wisdom, with your help, we may be able to do more for students. But the challenges you will face are far more complex than broken education. Quietly helping yourself is just the first step. Much more complex, and much greater, and far nobler challenges lie ahead., We can end poverty, but this is why we haven't by Teva Sienicki, "

It means\n        progressive, gradual learning and mastery.</p>\n      <p>It would be difficult, though not impossible, to learn to write words\n        without knowing the alphabet. English, or as I call it here &quot;The English\n        Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication&quot; bonds really well with\n        our ability to learn words as a baby. The language evolved with human\n        learning abilities. If English words were presented without letters, it\n        would still be a functional, but very different language.</p>\n      <p>Fundamentally, a framework without easy on-boarding, or progressive\n        adaptation features is kind of useless. If there is no way to learn\n        something, it won&#39;t be learned.</p>\n      <p>But overall, new on-boarding can be tacked on to something that previously\n        had trouble with it. For example in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Created_the_Integers\">God Created the Integers: The\n          Mathematical Breakthroughs That Changed History</a> Stephen Hawking helped\n        his memory by creating a history of evolution of mathematical thinking.

      "text": "You are a Genius.: Genius, is a collector, and a master of frameworks. One of the most pop frameworks, is English. Or as we will call it here: The English Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication. The \"Double U\", the 26 unsqiglies (as I call them - my original alphabet has extra squiggly letters I never knew what to do with). And then the comma and, Oxford Comma, the mysterious semicolon, the haunting tilde? Rhymes. Poems. Songs. Letters. Essays. Transcribing Lyrics, of a song that paused your time, classes, grades, parents? Memorizing Poems? Quotes? To thine own... yeah you did. Speaking. Reading. Writing., Thorgal: undefined, Frameworks are superpowers, and your powers will call to you.: Once you have the framework down, you gain special abilities, like Storytelling, for example. You can warp facts to construct fantasies based on real events and beings, now transformed into Mighty Ice Giants, maybe Dragons, Lost Worlds, and Faster Than Light Travel. You can encode a lifetime of experience in an exciting story with enchanted objects, and transcendental superhero journeys, here you can easily pass on a message across centuries. You can leave stones unturned that will mark forks and joins that will call to others to add to your story, to keep it alive across centuries even as English evolves., Story of Beowulf, Land of Monsters?: My friends, the story of Grendles Mōdor remains unfinished, Ides Aglæcwif of Ælwihta Eard; beacons her side to be writ. Was Grendles Modor a monster, would she be an Ide then? Was the Dragon a mere reminder, a clumsy blurb for Memento Mori or is that just the introduction to the real story, the story that has little to do with men like Beowulf who can't even take down a fat flying lizard right. A story burned to the ground by the spirit of the age, the Greatest Story Never Told, The Story of The Ides of the Old World. Pick up the pen. Rebuild the story a thousand times, and let the version 1001 earn you a place in history., The Dises (1909) by Dorothy Hardy.: undefined, A Pen is Mightier than a Sword.: Genius, is to answer the challenge. Ælwihta Eard, is the world of our childhood stories, from Baba Jaga, to The One Ring, to Harry Potter, and beyond. Genius is to pick up the pen, and not fear sounding foolish., Do not deny your Readers: Do not deny your stories to those who are still learning the lessons you have already mastered. What if your \"Not good enough\", will become the best they ever had? Mightier than The Sword., Damn kids. They're all alike.: When I was learning English, my most powerful piece of literature was The Conscience of a Hacker, or The Hacker Manifesto. (See External Links section for Hacker's Manifesto at Phrack Magazine) I am wiser now, the text is for a teenager. But I feel no shame for still holding it dear to my heart. I am glad to share with you., The Conscience of a Hacker by undefined: ... We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals., Damn kids. They're all alike.: These words are still as mighty as the day I found them., The Conscience of a Hacker read by The Mentor, You are a Genius.: Because storytelling, inspiration, sharing of wisdom, is just a part of The English Framework for Human Communication - that you mastered without noticing... as a child. At the age of 15 or earlier, you master a framework almost as complex as any of the more interesting Daughters of Philosophy (The Sciences). It comes to you so naturally, that you don't notice it. You think we are born with the ability for language. But, no. And not only do you learn it, your brain grows to match the complexity of information and tools needed to manipulate it., Neuro Genesis: You can grow new brain cells. Here's how by Sandrine Thuret, Genius, like Child Prodigy, is just a stepping stone. Don't stop.: You are to surpass what you think Genius is, on your way up, to growing all the way up. This act of transcendence will recur several times, depending how busy you get in life. Some things you think are one-way today; High School, Roswell, Globalization, Content of Character, Memorable Words, Superstars, Mokele-Mbembe, Spelling and Grammar (To use my teenage mind as example) will change meaning, as you grow; possibly/hopefully even reverse. Similar to how \"We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals.\" turns around, as we learn that Criminal Phreaking is just not worth the damn prison time. My Dear, Friends, Readers. You have mastered English. You have easily mastered something only a genius child prodigy could. Didn't even notice it, English came so naturally, so simply - didn't it? ... and you say you are not a Genius? Wow, just wow., English is Complex: Let me give you a hint on you how Frameworks like these emerge evolve across centuries., A History of English Letters, Good Frameworks come with Easy On-boarding: Easy On-boarding means easy access to eventual mastery. It means progressive, gradual learning and mastery. It would be difficult, though not impossible, to learn to write words without knowing the alphabet. English, or as I call it here \"The English Framework for Advanced Human to Human Communication\" bonds really well with our ability to learn words as a baby. The language evolved with human learning abilities. If English words were presented without letters, it would still be a functional, but very different language. Fundamentally, a framework without easy on-boarding, or progressive adaptation features is kind of useless. If there is no way to learn something, it won't be learned. But overall, new on-boarding can be tacked on to something that previously had trouble with it. For example in God Created the Integers: The Mathematical Breakthroughs That Changed History Stephen Hawking helped his memory by creating a history of evolution of mathematical thinking. I view the book as a Memory Palace with emphasis on historical dates and progression, that expands standard mathematical on-boarding and helps the reader to a greater initial spectrum of Mathematics., What if Schools Taught Us How to Learn by Jonathan Levi, Memorizing πr²: Do you remember memorizing πr²? Forcing memorization of πr² or any formula, should be seen as psychological torture, means of intimidation. It should be seen as cause for suspension of the teacher, and review and repair of the damage they made. Formula memorization is the same as being forced to learn English without the use of alphabet. It is incredibly cruel. Some young lady out there, tears in eyes can't comprehend πr², and her mind rejects memorization, she NEEDS to know - tears in eyes - why is the r is squared? Her mind reaching for why is the r multiplied by it self. Is there a geometric square somehow? Warm, but not warm enough. A brilliant mind yearning for arriving at the formula herself, yet forced to merely blindly accepting it, or repeating the whole year. People who need to invent the formulas, people who have the natural predisposition for abstract theoretical mathematics... The naturally predisposed for abstract mechanics or Mathematics, are being forced, not to, learn Mathematics, or be punished., Area of a circle, how to get the formula., Just Eyeball: Just witness that half the circumference of the circle (4 slices) are used at the the base of the rectangle, because the other four are used up top. It really does not matter how many divisions of the circle so as long as reaching infinity makes for an infinitely perfect rectangle ❤, The Framework is Mightier Than The Formula: Armed with this knowledge, our young lady, can arrive at her own πr², when needed. But also at E=mc², and all the wonderful rest. And so can you. My Genius Reader., Genius Is Our Right: Genius is knowing the framework mechanics, and reinventing the formulas as needed. Sometimes, applying mechanics from one place by subtle analogy to another. For example apply lessons from trains and their relativity of motion and distortion of sound waves, to other things..., Simple Relativity - Understanding Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, Einstein's Proof of E=mc2, Math: Math is almost too easy to bother with, it is certainly too messy when compared to the exquisite and wonderfully unambiguous and vast world of programming. Basic programming is enough to visualize all the important things in mathematics. Math as Code It was only ever intimidating because it is a primitive language meant for paper and pencil, with an ugly problem to boot. As Math as Code notes \"Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author, context and the field of study (linear algebra, set theory, etc).\" It can be a wonderful and enlightening adventure to visit works of Newton from the simple world of programming, but to teach Calculus on paper is to waste your time on trivialities of a simple loop. Let us face that today's \"Alphabet of Math\" is basic Programming. This is because programming notation is not as ambiguous, and it is easier to latch-on-to-and-pursue mathematical concepts, as trivial as they will turn out to be to you now. As an enormous bonus, at the end of the day you can see your new knowledge come to life with a simple, mathematically themed program like P5js or maybe D3, or even SVG (keep it in sync with leading Web Technologies as they receive most attention and thus good programming, exposure, use, and as a bonus bring a solid measure of fair employment opportunities). Some are moved by Ides, others by Numbers. As numbers can now come to life when transitioning from dead paper to colorful screens, games, visualizations., Karlie Kloss explains how to use math with the artist in Code Studio, Easy as π: Look a the ease with which Karlie Kloss teaches real, live, moving, interactive, Modern Math to children. It is not just Drag and Drop programming, with works like Math as Code children who enjoy it, get access to Theoretical Physics and Abstract Mathematics. A child using the program that Karlie teaches with will see little surface difference between making a rectangle and converting matter to energy via Einstein's E=mc². A venture into the function contents, which are not too complex as shown in the previous video, may perhaps create a new Einstein, change the World, or Time, or better yet, both. In this short clip she interjects the use of variables and dynamic calculation; as a result she creates a reusable function that creates rectangles with a base twice the height. For many this is a mind blowing lesson that will call to them, pull them into the world of Math, Computers, Science, Technology. Kode With Klossy shows what these classes are like. What real education looks like, where teachers strive to be worthy of teaching their students., Frameworks: Why., Genius.: Study your Frameworks. Generations have tried to avoid Genius, and the World is hurting for it. We are bound to this planet, chemically, biologically, even intellectually. We are all connected. There is no moving to Mars. And we were never allowed to let the TV, or the talking-heads, or lairs, do the talking - with each new generation, doubly so., We are all connected., Accept The Responsibility: People laugh off running out of water, but that's actually terribly simple. It will happen like this: U.S. drinking water widely contaminated with 'forever chemicals' But remember, all problems created by Humans, can be solved by Humans too., Those That Can't Do, Teach., Memorization is Over: Tell your teacher that memorization is over, it is useless to you. Tell your teachers that they are not allowed to stand in your way of real knowledge. They are interrupting your real education by threatening to mark you down for not following their worthless directions which can only lead to memorization, which in turn will soon result in you forgetting what you force-remembered. It is not possible to retain long-term what you memorized in the way you did it. If that is what they expect of you, then you maybe being taken advantage of. The motive is teacher getting paid, and ultimately, school qualifying for more funding. GPA or not, you still need those Marvelous Frameworks; or people will easily mislead you. One example is Vaccine Hesitancy which a lot of people fall for, but there are more complicated and closer calls like CFCs and Tetraethyl Lead, and now PFAS. You need to be knowledgeable enough to foresee consequences of what is going on in the world. Your life depends on it. The future of this planet depends on You, don't count on the adults, they're all going to retire of old age soon enough. Your life depends on real education, your knowledge has impact on everything from internal decision making, to external politics of the whole World. The teacher will soon retire, feel great about all the great work, and you will become the future. Just, take it upon yourselves to learn on your own, it is safer this way. You can stay in school, learn in library and from audio books. Real knowledge will always beat what you memorized and forgot., Genius by Mark Diaz, The Future, The World: You were born a Genius. You are a Genius. It is not even that big of a deal, you are a human with a brain, Genius is what we do. On the other end, people saying they are better than you because they are a Genius, are sick from poverty of mind, they got fractured, stuck. It is sad, let us hope they feel better and catch up, but pass them on as they heal. Keep moving forward, keep learning, the World needs you to grow, to grow all the way up, you, and all your peers, and all generations to come. It is the journey of self education that makes the real difference. Begin your journey under the banner of Unrelenting Pursuit of Excellence and Love of Wisdom. The Future, and The World, it will all be Yours. You are far more than Genius. Unbreakable. Unstoppable. Uncontainable. Unpredictable. Uncontrollable. You Are The Future., "

Known as a campaigner for women's suffrage via legislative change, from 1897 until 1919 she led Britain's largest women's rights organisation, the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies., The road between the past and the future is long, but it continues unbroken.: Relative to their beginnings, many will find just enough comfort and stop, and often block traffic. If you rise in class. Your teachers will fight you, because they just want to do their job, go home, and get paid. If you rise in class. They will say you are disrupting the class and throw you out, because they just want you to shut up so they can finish their job and go watch some TV. You can talk to the Principal or Dean, but they'll just tag you as \"Gifted\" and you'll graduate from Adult Ed so fast you'll struggle to remember where it all started and what the battle was for., Because The Battle Is Not For You: The battle is for those that come; after you. In short term, you get a sweet sliver of solace as you learn that in the end all your troubles ended up counting towards protecting others from the same. In long term, you help the world grow, it won't be your world, it will be the world of the future. The battle for real education, and enjoying the fruits of real education are two separate things. It will make you tired., How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood., Bad News: There are very few Alternate Education resources, and as you rise you realize that the Start-up Accelerator rates are extremely low, almost too low. Nothing, nothing is as sweet and easy as putting up with broken education, the broken rules, the status quo, staying in school, getting some \"good\" grades, making your parents happy. Nothing is as easy as forgetting all of that ever happened, and make up excuses after excuses, forgetting everyone and everything, and never looking back. Alas, Dear Henry comes to our rescue., Henry David Thoreau: I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms..., The Good News: Real Education, is not about getting really educated. It is about Your Life, Dignity, Authenticity, Health. Life that revolves around sweet and easy and making everyone else happy is not a healthy life., Faith of the Heart, Article One: Inherent Dignity, Nobility.: The first and foremost, you must Retain Your Dignity, and your Nobility. No one is to treat you as means to their end, to their paycheck, or vacation, or else. You are not to be silenced, you are not to go quietly into the night, you are to rage, to rage against the dying of the light., Self Education starts With Life Changing Books: Best way to understand a book, is to listen to the Author reading it.

Y Combinator and Techstars., Y Combinator: Website · Y Combinator on YouTube Startup School Videos, What is Y Combinator?, How and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman & Dustin Moskovitz (44 minute lecture), Investors Are Waiting: Y Combinator created Requests for Startups, a list of startup ideas they are waiting for. It includes Enterprise Software, Financial Services, Programming Tools, and Computer Security to name a few., YC Partner AMA at the Female Founders Conference, Fundraising Advice from Female Founders, The Most Important Decision is Getting Started – Laura Behrens Wu, Mariya Nurislamova, Founder of Scentbird at the Female Founders Conference, Emily Weiss on the Insights That Grew Glossier - With Amy Buechler at the Female Founders Conference, Techstars: Website · Techstars on YouTube, What is Techstars?, What Techstars Gave Me - Founder Stories, Mary Haskett, Founder of Blink Identity, Sky Kelley, Founder of Avisare, Sun Tzu: Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win., Mastery of Subject: What Sun Tzu hoped we understood was this: \"Victorious warriors, master the sword before the battle; while defeated warriors hope to learn how to use the sword during their first sword-fight.\" Creating a tiny company with a winning product, even without filling out any paperwork. Will give you all the tools you need to sit down with an Accelerator, or your first investors and show them the relationship between advertising budget, number of developers, and product sales. What may feel intimidating when all you have, is an idea; will become energizing, and empowering when you have some sales to show for it., It Is a Big World: Large Startup Accelerator acceptance rates are between 1% and 3%, but there are many more smaller ones. Remember, you and your investors are connected. They make money, when you make money. Armed with a winning idea you already covered a great deal of distance towards success., Good Ideas: A good idea, already has desperate customers searching for a way in. Google Ads is a Good Idea.

Sitting down to build your program, and invent it too, is only good for research, and not for meeting serious implementation goals or deadlines. You must separate yourself from the implementation (of which, in the end, there may be many). You must become the leader, the protector of your vision. And lead - that's right - lead your team to victory., Source of Ideas: The best source of ideas, is a list of Winning Companies. Investors Requesting for Startups.
