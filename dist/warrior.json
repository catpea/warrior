They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be used\n  for good. They have compassion. They help their fellow men at every\n  opportunity. If an opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to\n  find one.</p>\n<h3 id=\"respect\">Respect</h3>\n<p>True warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do not need to prove their\n  strength. Warriors are not only respected for their strength in battle, but\n  also by their dealings with others. The true strength of a warrior becomes\n  apparent during difficult times.</p>\n<h3 id=\"integrity\">Integrity</h3>\n<p>When warriors say that they will perform an action, it is as good as done.\n  Nothing will stop them from completing what they say they will do. They do\n  not have to ‘give their word’. They do not have to ‘promise’. Speaking and\n  doing are the same action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"honour\">Honour</h3>\n<p>Warriors have only one judge of honor and character, and this is\n  themselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are carried out are\n  a reflection of whom they truly are. You cannot hide from yourself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"duty-and-loyalty\">Duty and Loyalty</h3>\n<p>Warriors are responsible for everything that they have done and everything\n  that they have said, and all of the consequences that follow. They are\n  immensely loyal to all of those in their care. To everyone that they are\n  responsible for, they remain fiercely true.</p>\n<h3 id=\"self-control\">Self-Control</h3>\n<p>Warriors feel more than others. This calmness of behavior and composure of\n  mind is rooted in the choice of endurance without a groan, wisdom over\n  ignorance, understanding over confrontation, love over anger, and\n  unbreakability in the face of suffering and loneliness.</p>"

Sweetened water (sometimes V8 tomato juice) and\n  good music are the two things that I find most helpful during my routine.</p>\n<p>In weight lifting there maybe difficult discomfort 5 – 10 lifts into some\n  routine, then you switch to some other exercise (for example from <a href=\"https://youtu.be/av7-8igSXTs\">Standing\n    Dumbbell Curls</a> to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Gu1t7X2yq4M?t=153\">Overhead Shoulder Press</a> where your biceps rest\n  while you perform the shoulder press), you never sit, you never lie, you\n  use both arms, both legs, you don’t stop to rest. <strong>If you need to stop\nthen your weights are too heavy</strong>, and your workout is not working out.</p>\n<p>Start in the beginning, come to the end, and then stop. Start with 3.5lb\n  per hand, even if out of humility, even if just to remind yourself that you\n  always start in the beginning, and you always finish what you start.</p>"

In fact if you record a single piano key, you can almost\n  recreate the piano entirely by replaying that one piano key at different\n  frequencies/notes (A note like _middle C_, is just a named frequency, in\n  this case 261.63 Hz.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)\">Sampling</a> is the art of borrowing a sound, or even a little bit of a song (as in Lofi Hip Hop) and frequently replaying it at a different frequency. You can also sample sounds around you to create unique drums, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-hat\">hats</a>, even piano or some lo-tech violin out of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS4gZcjSHk4\">flinging a doorstop</a>.

She is almost doing drums with\n  her left hand, she is laying down the beat.</p>\n<p>Ignore her left hand, now.</p>\n<p>Look at her right hand, at first she goes up and down. Then she does the\n  pinky &amp; thumb, but still, even though she is playing notes apart, see it as\n  one note, pay attention to thumb only. She does jump between keys, but it\n  is rare and masked by her left hand that is doing the beat.</p>\n<p>The keys she presses at the same time with her right hand should be seen as\n  one key, she is just mixing two sounds together to create a third sound.\n  When she presses two keys at the same time, she is adding a third key.</p>\n<p>Why add keys to the piano. Because two keys at the same time sounds richer\n  than pressing one key.</p>\n<p>Making a single sound out of pressing multiple keys at the same time, is\n  called making a chord. Chords are multiple notes played at the same time,\n  for the purpose of enriching the complexity of what you hear.</p>\n<p>Left hand does the simple beat, it must always be simple.</p>\n<p>Right hand does the melody, slowly goes up and down, in this particular\n  video chords aside, she only skips one key to get to the next note.</p>\n<p>All of this is obscured, because she was taught Music Theory compatible\n  with Mozart &amp; Chopin.</p>\n<p>You are being taught to break out. Chords are beautiful for sure, but, you\n  just use the recording (the sound sample a .wav/mp3 of the chord) and focus\n  on composition.</p>\n<p>Melodies are not made by learning how to play a piano.

The demoscene is an international computer art subculture focused on producing demos: self-contained, sometimes extremely small, computer programs that produce audio-visual presentations. The purpose of a demo is to show off programming, visual art, and musical skills. Demos and other demoscene productions are shared at festivals known as demoparties, voted on by those who attend, and released online. Take a look at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmldRs7P8wI&amp;list=PL9HVvEQXdWVY3_QkiBh-aWRfxKW7DJezG\">Best Of Demoscene 2019 on YouTube</a></p>"

The manual command is\n  called man and people usually type man followed by the command-name that\n  they want to learn about. In this case: man say (meaning bring up the\n  manual page for the say command). The man page will tell you how you can\n  list all the available voices too (say -v=?), a command like say can do\n  multiple things based on what you are trying to do. Here is the internet\n  version of a man page for say: <a href=\"https://ss64.com/osx/say.html\">https://ss64.com/osx/say.html</a></p>\n<p>People are not happy with this.

A\n  programmer should demand that his program code has good hygiene. eSpeak\n  simply said “I am not just going to read everything that you type at me”\n  whereas the programmer that made the say command said “Let’s just assume\n  that whatever they throw at us needs to be converted to speech unless\n  something starts with a hyphen”. The say command makes assumptions, whereas\n  espeak is very strict about input.</p>"

The\n  members of this culture originated the term ‘hacker’. Hackers built the\n  Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today. Hackers\n  make the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this culture, if you have\n  contributed to it and other people in it know who you are and call you a\n  hacker, you’re a hacker.</p>\n<p>The hacker mind-set is not confined to this software-hacker culture. There\n  are people who apply the hacker attitude to other things, like electronics\n  or music — actually, you can find it at the highest levels of any science\n  or art. Software hackers recognize these kindred spirits elsewhere and may\n  call them ‘hackers’ too — and some claim that the hacker nature is really\n  independent of the particular medium the hacker works in.</p>\n<p>There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but\n  aren&#39;t. These are people (mainly adolescent males, and little girls) who\n  get a kick out of breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system.\n  Real hackers call these people ‘crackers’ and want nothing to do with them.\n  Real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not very\n  bright, and object that being able to break security doesn&#39;t make you a\n  hacker any more than being able to hot-wire cars makes you an automotive\n  engineer. Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled into\n  using the word ‘hacker’ to describe crackers; this irritates real hackers\n  no end.</p>\n<p>The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break them.”</p>"

The Shopify Theme Partnerships team is on a mission to\n  make sure our merchants have access to the highest quality themes\n  available. Every month, thousands of merchants look for new themes for\n  their online stores. Our team is on the lookout for skilled, passionate\n  designers and developers we can work with to create amazing themes for the\n  Theme Store.</p>\n<h5 id=\"important-information-to-know-before-you-apply\">Important information to know before you apply</h5>\n<p>Here are a few things to consider before you send us your Theme Partner\n  application:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Shopify themes need constant care and attention. We expect Theme\n    Partners who work with us to be engaged, passionate about their theme(s),\n    and apply any theme updates we request in a timely manner.</li>\n  <li>Being a Theme Partner is a full-time job. You will need to dedicate a\n    lot of time updating your theme(s) as well as supporting the merchants who\n    are using your theme. If you become a Theme Partner, you’ll need to\n    consider how you’ll balance Theme Partner work with other jobs you are\n    currently doing, or are planning to be engaged in.</li>\n  <li>Our current Theme Partners are a tight-knit group of people. We expect\n    potential Theme Partners to be approachable and collaborative with the\n    Shopify Theme Partnerships team, as well as merchants using your theme(s).</li>\n  <li>We want Theme Partners to actively contribute to the Shopify themes\n    ecosystem, and work with us to help merchants succeed. The Theme\n    Partnerships team will be working closely with you every step of the way\n    during the theme submission process, and will continue to work closely with\n    you once your theme is published. We have dedicated email and Slack\n    channels set up to provide feedback, advice and support for all your\n    theme-related questions and issues.</li>\n  <li>The revenue share for Theme Partners is 70/30. The Theme Partner\n    receives 70% of each theme sale.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5 id=\"what-to-submit-when-you-apply\">What to submit when you apply</h5>\n<p>Please email themes@shopify.com and include all of the following:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>A link to an active Shopify website you built for a client. This must\n    be a live, fully functioning shop that you built for a client.</li>\n  <li>A case study for the above Shopify website that details your\n    experiences on the project. You will need to provide an overview of the\n    project and the client.</li>\n  <li>A cover letter.</li>\n  <li>A link to your design portfolio.</li>\n</ol>\n<h5 id=\"how-we-review-your-application\">How we review your application</h5>\n<p>For the <strong>active Shopify website</strong> our review will cover:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Problem solving ability (the solution outlined in the case study is\n    visible).</li>\n  <li>Originality (the shop is using a custom theme, not a free or paid theme\n    from the Shopify Theme Store).</li>\n  <li>Art direction (choice of photography, images, icons, color, and overall\n    originality).</li>\n  <li>Layout (flow of content, hierarchy, balance, contrast, white space,\n    responsiveness, grid, and alignment).</li>\n  <li>Typography (font pairings, font sizes, line spacing, hierarchy of text,\n    number of fonts used, and legibility of text).</li>\n  <li>Consistency in design patterns (between pages and on a single page).</li>\n  <li>Accessibility (hover states, colour ratios, and touch targets).</li>\n  <li>Customer UX (purchase flow through the collection, product, and cart\n    pages).</li>\n  <li>Technical ability (up-to-date with Shopify platform, website\n    functionality, code consistency, and lack of errors).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the <strong>case study</strong> we will be looking for you to provide this\n  information:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>What brought the client to you?</li>\n  <li>What were the client’s needs?</li>\n  <li>How did you go about solving their problem?</li>\n  <li>We would like to see your research, your workflow (prototyping and\n    refining), and what you learned.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the <strong>cover letter</strong> we would like to see the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>An outline of who you (and your team) are.</li>\n  <li>Why you want to join the Shopify Theme Partner community?</li>\n  <li>Why you think you’d do well as a Theme Partner?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Feel free to put your own personal touch or spin on the cover letter. We\n  highly value originality, enthusiasm, and motivation when considering\n  applications.</p>\n<p>For the <strong>design portfolio</strong> we will be reviewing the same design related\n  points as mentioned above for the active Shopify website:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Art direction.</li>\n  <li>Layout.</li>\n  <li>Typography.</li>\n  <li>Consistency.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Shopify Theme Partnerships team is not able to provide detailed\n  feedback on why an application does not pass our review process.

Please do not distribute your theme on other marketplaces\n  or third-party channels, or try to take customers away from the Theme Store.</p>\n<h5 id=\"theme-support\">Theme support</h5>\n<p>If there is a technical issue with your theme (for example: broken layout,\n  dead link, logic error) you will be responsible for fixing the issue in a\n  timely fashion. Critical bugs must be fixed immediately or your theme may\n  be temporarily removed from the Theme Store.</p>\n<p>Theme Partners are responsible for supporting merchants who use their\n  theme(s). You will need to provide a public support email address, theme\n  documentation, and assist merchants with their theme-related questions.</p>\n<p>Themes will be removed from the Theme Store if they have made less than 25\n  sales in a 3 month time period. Theme Partners are responsible for keeping\n  their themes up-to-date with core Shopify features and any improved\n  standards Shopify implements in the future. These can include improvements\n  to the overall user experience, the user interface, accessibility, and more.</p>"

Write about the lessons that counted to\n  make them last even longer. Create an Audio Book in your own voice in hopes\n  of it being used 50 years from now to Rise &amp; Learn to Really Learn. What an\n  Honor to have your spirit revived by means of Admiration and Love, your own\n  voice across decades, maybe centuries, maybe forever.</p>\n<p>Instead, the children are getting scared, mostly because they can see\n  schools are forcing irrelevant learning that fades away.

Having your team create a powerful computer program is one thing, but making it look nice; is another. This is why theme websites make sales.
