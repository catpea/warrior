I am going to move adding a new chapter from Friday evening to Sunday evening.

This is because I am a little bit more rested on Sundays.

If anybody is watching this, I am sorry if I am ruining your weekly plans.

But I still feel we are nearing some milestone, a possible completion of this project, maybe.

If so, I had an amazing time creating this. Thank You.

I hope for this work to become a set of lectures with an aim to help people see that we are all the same, that our differences are tiny, and we are each a Mighty Genius and a Great Adventurer.

Could you make a project similar to this? Could you help the world grow as well, Dear Reader.

I also publish and narrate poetry on [https://catpea.com/](https://catpea.com/) I am up to 194 poems at the time of this note.

All good things come to a point where they must transform into something greater,  
Thank You.

### May 4th 2020, 7:29:00 pm EDT
The [Theme Switcher Code](https://github.com/catpea/warrior/blob/master/templates/pico/files/js/theme-switch.js) is now more readable, it uses jQuery on the home page for button logic.

The chapters use standard albeit modern JavaScript. There is no way to switch themes from within chapters, the user has to go to the Table of Contents page, scroll to the bottom click Color Mode, force/reset theme, and then go back to reading.

If I find that I won't be adding anymore jQuery things, then I'll rewrite button logic and time-ago in plain JavaScript and removing the jQuery dependency.

It is of some note that only the default presentation of the Warrior Book requires jQuery, other presentations, written in different frameworks use their own ways of dealing with themes.

Furthermore, when JavaScript is disabled there are not broken buttons/features, the Color Mode in the Table of Contents pare will not display. This is crafted for archival purposes, that's what this while website is about, allowing Internet Archives to crawl the book, and display it correctly without any special needs.


### May 4th 2020, 5:40:52 pm EDT
It took hours to sort out issues with the CHANGELOG, I ended up creating a [database with records](https://github.com/catpea/warrior/tree/master/changelog), then the [HTML website version](https://catpea.github.io/warrior/changelog.html), and a [GitHub version](https://github.com/catpea/warrior/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) as well. I added the "ago" timestamps, and set them update live.

I used jQuery, for the time-agos, I'll guess I'll use it for the color/theme switcher as well. jQuery is getting old, but the time-ago feature took only [ten lines of code](https://github.com/catpea/warrior/blob/master/templates/pico/files/js/changelog-ago.js) that's hard to do with pure [DOM functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents).


### May 3rd 2020, 5:38:00 pm EDT
I am upgrading the theme, there were some problems with [Edward Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) so I switched to [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/) for now. As a result the book can read your browser settings, and if your operating system is in dark-mode the website will appear dark as well. There is also a persistent manual override, where you can flip your mode and it will stay that way.

It is not a very tidy program I just patched Pico code, I need to rewrite that from ground up. Beyond this I need to work on the Changelog, I mangled the timestamps, I wasn't sure what to do with them, and now I have some programming to do. A lot of things are tricky here because I want this book to be archivable by robots, like [The Way Back Machine](https://archive.org/web/). That means, no server junk, no external dependencies, no odd java-script (basically the website needs to work with JavaScript disabled.)


### May 1st 2020, 11:32:00 pm EDT
Created a new chapter [The Ukulele Player](the-ukulele-player.html).


### April 30th 2020, 8:26:00 pm EDT
Added the [Foreword](foreword.html) poem along with audio version.


### April 30th 2020, 12:47:00 pm EDT
Rebuilt the Build System and Switched to [Edward Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).


### April 24th 2020, 10:00:51 pm EDT
Created a new chapter [The Mine Explorer](the-mine-explorer.html) I moved a couple of videos from [The Explorer](the-explorer.html) into it.


### April 17th 2020, 8:53:34 pm EDT
Created a new chapter [The Cryptographer](the-cryptographer.html).


### April 10th 2020, 11:39:59 pm EDT

Added a revolutionary new chapter [The Composer](the-composer.html).


### March 19th 2020, 7:29:38 pm EDT
Updated [The Highschooler](the-highschooler.html) adding notes on dangers and bringing becoming a Founder as a safer, healthier, more educational, alternative.


### March 18th 2020, 12:43:38 pm EDT
Created [The Highschooler](the-highschooler.html) out of [The Courageous](the-courageous.html), and added a new chapter [The Principal](the-principal.html). The Highschooler is an expansion of the "Notes from an Imaginary High School". Both chapters still need work, some of the more the spicy parts need to be flattened out. I added 8 new life changing videos. And I discovered [another Mad World that someone made out of Breakfast Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxRTHq5uBbg), I added that too. I also added [Gary Jules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1Nq086QB1Q) next to Izzie Naylor in [The Musician](the-musician.html).


### March 13th 2020, 11:04:07 pm EDT
Added a bit more on Roman Kondrachov's warrior training for Ukrainian Folk Dance in [The Dancer](the-dancer.html). And closed the Dancer section with a Detailed (22 min.) [Russian Squat Kick tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FLThlB_OWc), thus unifying [The Dancer](the-dancer.html) with [The Athlete](the-athlete.html)


### March 13th 2020, 10:45:25 pm EDT
Added an eight-video section about dancing to the Rasputin song (and Ukrainian Folk) in [The Dancer](the-dancer.html).


### March 13th 2020, 9:50:27 pm EDT

### March 6th 2020, 11:02:52 pm EST
Added a [link](https://realsalt.com/why-do-some-japanese-restaurants-keep-piles-of-salt-outside/) to explanation as to why those two idiots found salt in front of the Sushi Bar in [The Chef](the-chef.html). (Ma-ma-ma-ma... oh-### to-to, ma-ma-ma-ma, Oh-to-to-to, I used to think that video was probably for real, just that Japanese culture was so odd - Oof.)


### March 6th 2020, 10:19:55 pm EST
I originally somewhat planned to add "The Inventor" as a precursor to The Founder but Bret Victor, Chase Lewis and Ann Makosinski are not just inventors, or rather we are all inventors and as with Genius it is not that big of a deal. They are Students and a Programmer, so I added them along with a few others to existing chapters. I haven't left much room between [The Courageous](the-courageous.html) and [The Visionary](the-visionary.html) The Inventor would not fit there very well. In addition I moved the Learning Toolkit (Mind/Concept Mapping) from Visionary to The Courageous adding [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) and [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) (as examples of learning tools), as unique visions of the future begin with real education (self-education).


### March 6th 2020, 10:19:55 pm EST
Added [Bret Victor's Inventing on Principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII) to [The Programmer](the-programmer.html).

### February 29th 2020, 9:04:49 am EST
Updated [The Courageous](the-courageous.html) with the tiny "Article One". I hope someday this will grow to become a Universal Declaration of Student Rights, that a student who is not yet ready to voice her or his opinions can hold up in class as a symbol and reminder. Where we ask teachers to step away until they show that they are capable of helping and not interfering, with Real Education.


### February 28th 2020, 10:32:48 pm EST
Updated [The Courageous](the-courageous.html) with A Short History of Nearly Everything, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries, What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions, and The Physics of Superheroes.
