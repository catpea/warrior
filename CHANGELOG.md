  to-to, ma-ma-ma-ma, Oh-to-to-to, I used to think that video was probably for real, just that Japanese culture was so odd - Oof.)

### March 6th 2020, 10:19:55 pm
I originally somewhat planned to add "The Inventor" as a precursor to The Founder but Bret Victor, Chase Lewis and Ann Makosinski are not just inventors, or rather we are all inventors and as with Genius it is not that big of a deal. They are Students and a Programmer, so I added them along with a few others to existing chapters. I haven't left much room between [The Courageous] and [The Visionary] The Inventor would not fit there very well. In addition I moved the Learning Toolkit (Mind/Concept Mapping) from Visionary to The Courageous adding [Readwise] and [Anki] (as examples of learning tools), as unique visions of the future begin with real education (self-education).

### February 29th 2020, 9:04:49 am
Updated [The Courageous] with the tiny "Article One". I hope someday this will grow to become a Universal Declaration of Student Rights, that a student who is not yet ready to voice her or his opinions can hold up in class as a symbol and reminder. Where we ask teachers to step away until they show that they are capable of helping and not interfering, with Real Education.

### February 28th 2020, 10:32:48 pm
Updated [The Courageous] with A Short History of Nearly Everything, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries, What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions, and The Physics of Superheroes.
